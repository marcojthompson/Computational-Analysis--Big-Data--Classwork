'''Tempus''' is the name of two fictional characters appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The first Tempus initially appeared in ''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' #2 and was created by [[Gerry Conway]] and [[John Buscema]]. He is an enormous humanoid who dwells in [[Limbo (Marvel Comics)|Limbo]] and serves [[Immortus]]. An immortal creature created from the stuff of Limbo, Tempus views his undying nature as a curse, and often remarks that he would consider execution a suitable reward for his services to Immortus.

The second Tempus first appeared in ''All-New X-Men'' #1 and was created by [[Brian Michael Bendis]] and [[Stuart Immonen]]. Eva Bell is an [[Australian]] teenager, who can create time-freezing bubbles and teleport people through time. Tempus is a new member of the [[Uncanny X-Men#2013–2015: Volume 3|Uncanny X-Men]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Servant of Immortus===
On his master's behalf, the first Tempus has fought many different superheroes, including the [[Fantastic Four]],<ref>''Giant-Size Fantastic Four'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the [[West Coast Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers West Coast'' #62. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was fought and defeated by [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] as part of a plot by Immortus to rob Thor of his ability to travel in time using [[Mjolnir (Marvel Comics)|Mjolnir]].<ref>''Thor'' #281. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The [[Avengers Forever|Destiny War]] was ignited when Immortus sent Tempus to kill an apparently critically ill [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] on the moon. He was defeated by [[Kang the Conqueror]],{{issue|date=August 2020}} but was later rejuvenated in the same series by Immortus and sent to fight [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].{{issue|date=August 2020}} Tempus' plan to defeat the hero by regressing him backwards through time to the point of non-existence backfired when Hawkeye regained his lost [[Goliath (Marvel Comics)|size changing]] abilities, granting him enough power to defeat Tempus again.{{issue|date=August 2020}}

===Eva Bell===

Eva Bell is a goth-punk teenager from [[Gold Coast, Queensland]]. When her powers newly manifest, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] appears and asks her to join his new [[Uncanny X-Men#2013–2015: Volume 3|X-Men]]. She at first doesn't want to and prefers a normal teenage life, but then the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] come to recruit her and she decides she will not have a normal life and Cyclops's team will be cooler. She then creates a time bubble that freezes the Avengers, so they can escape.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' (vol. 3) #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

Eva uses her time travel to erase the threat of Matthew Malloy, a mutant that was obliterating the Earth. She travels back in time to a younger Professor Xaiver. Matthew's parents never quite meet, thus erasing the threat from the timeline.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol 3 #29 (December 2014)</ref>

In the pages of ''[[House of X and Powers of X]]'' when the X-Men made [[Krakoa]] a mutant paradise, Tempus became part of [[The Five (comics)|the Five]] who were charged with the duty of resurrecting fallen mutants through a process called the "transcendent" which recreates their bodies, restores their powers, and restores their memories at the time of their deaths. Tempus' part involves accelerating the growth of Goldballs' unviable eggs after [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] is done with the cellular replication. This was first shown when [[Professor X|X]] had the Five restore [[Warren Worthington III|Archangel]], Cyclops, [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], [[Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[M (Marvel Comics)|Penance]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] following a mission that involved stopping [[Nimrod (comics)|Nimrod]].<ref>''House of X'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> Tempus and the Five were also seen when the [[United Nations]] recognized Krakoa as a sovereign nation as well as the first meeting with the Quiet Council.<ref>''House of X'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Endowed with enormous strength and wielding a club, the first Tempus could trade blows with enemies such as Thor and the alien monster [[Alioth (comics)|Alioth]]. His body was composed of the stuff of Limbo itself, which Immortus could control and use to summon an army of trillions from across time to fight [[Kang the Conqueror]]. Tempus also seemed to have some chronal powers as well, as evidenced by his aforementioned attempt to defeat Hawkeye.

Eva Bell has the ability to create time bubbles that freeze anybody trapped inside. She can also create time bubbles that freeze lasers and bullets. She also learns later that she can teleport others into the future, like when during a training session she teleports Magik 10 seconds into the future. As a young mutant she does not know the extent of her powers.
