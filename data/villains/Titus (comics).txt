'''Titus''' is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Titus first appeared in ''[[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Nova]]'' Vol. 5 #1 and was created by [[Jeph Loeb]] and [[Ed McGuinness]].

==Fictional character biography==
Titus is an unnamed [[white tiger]] alien who was a member of the [[Supernova (Marvel Comics)|Supernovas]], a [[Black operation|black ops]] branch of the [[Nova Corps]]. He served with Jesse Alexander (the father of [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Sam Alexander]]), Mister Z'zz, The Phlish, and a few other Supernovas.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 5 #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following the desertion of Jesse Alexander, Titus was attacked by the [[Chitauri]] which led to the loss of Titus' right eye and arm causing him to replace his missing parts with cybernetics. After serving the Chitauri for several years, Titus came to Earth in search of Jesse Alexander's Nova helmet.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 5 #3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Titus lies to Sam Alexander telling him that he had killed his father. This is not true because Jesse Alexander is being held captive by the Chitauri. When Titus finds Sam, he threatens not only him, but everything he holds dearly to him in exchange for the [[Ultimate Nullifier]] he stole from their ship. Sam then gets back his helmet from Titus and takes them both to outer space, expecting the lack of oxygen to kill Titus. When that plan fails, Sam takes out the Ultimate Nullifier and tells Titus to take his forces and leave. Titus and Sam then struggle for the Ultimate Nullifier and Sam accidentally triggers it killing Titus and an entire fleet of Chitauri.<ref>''Nova'' Vol. 5 #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Titus somehow turned up alive when he and [[Death's Head]] ambush Sam and [[Nova (Richard Rider)|Richard Rider]] in [[Knowhere]].<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = Jeff Loveness and Ramon Perez|penciller = Ramon Perez|inker = Ramon Perez|colorist = Ian Herring|letterer = Comicraft's Albert Deschesne|editor = Devin Lewis|title = Nova|volume = 7|issue = #2|date = 4 January 2017|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
* Titus appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[JB Blanc]].<ref name="btva">{{cite web|title=Titus Voice - Marvel Universe franchise <nowiki>|</nowiki> Behind The Voice Actors|url=https://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Marvel-Universe/Titus/|website=behindthevoiceactors.com|date=December 21, 2019|postscript=.

In the episode "Return of the Guardians of the Galaxy", Titus discovered a Nova helmet on Earth and attempts to retrieve it, only to be defeated by [[Nova (Sam Alexander)|Sam Alexander]], [[Spider-Man]], and the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (2008 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]. In "Contest of Champions" Pt. 4, the [[Grandmaster (Marvel Comics)|Grandmaster]] has Titus, [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Absorbing Man]], and the [[Executioner (comics)|Executioner]] fight Spider-Man, [[Captain America]], and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Hawkeye]].
* Titus appears in the ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' animated series, voiced again by JB Blanc.<ref name="btva"/> This version joined the Nova Corps to become involved in the intergalactic black market. Following a minor appearance in the episode "Origins", Titus appears in the episode "Take the ''Milano'' and Run" when the Guardians of the Galaxy encounter him on the space station ''Conjunction''. Titus and the Nova Corpsmen with him attempt to arrest the Guardians, but they defeat him before leaving ''Conjunction''. In the episode "Can't Fight This Seedling", Titus pursues the Guardians, but ends up crash-landing on a nearby planet and contacts his superiors to request the use of an anti-matter missile. Though they deny him, he attempts to use it anyway, only for [[Drax the Destroyer]] to redirect it into an asteroid. Titus later tries to arrest the Guardians again, but is stopped by the alien locals. In the episode "Undercover Angle", Titus catches the Guardians while they are infiltrating the Nova Corps's headquarters, but chooses not to arrest them in exchange for them infiltrating the [[Black Order (comics)|Black Order]], ostensibly to keep them from finding [[Ronan the Accuser]]'s Universal Weapon. Amidst the Guardians and Black Order's fight over the weapon, Titus attacks both groups to claim it for himself and give it to the [[Collector (character)|Collector]], forcing the two groups to temporarily work together to stop Titus. During the fight, [[Star-Lord]] records Titus confessing his true motives for joining the Nova Corps and sends it to his superiors. While he defeats the Black Order, Titus is defeated by the Guardians in turn and arrested by the Nova Corps, vowing revenge. In the episode "Rock Your Baby", a rogue Nova Centurion helmet enables Titus to escape his imprisonment and pursue vengeance against the Guardians. After tracking them down, he attempts to convince [[Adam Warlock]] to destroy the Guardians, but Warlock traps Titus in his gem. Titus also makes a minor appearance in the episode "You Do Not Always Get What You Want" as one of several prisoners in Warlock's gem.
