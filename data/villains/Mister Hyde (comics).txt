'''Mister Hyde''' ('''Calvin Zabo''') is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He is primarily an enemy of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and is the father of [[Daisy Johnson]].

Calvin Zabo appeared in the television series ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' in the second season, which is set in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], portrayed by [[Kyle MacLachlan]].

==Publication history==
Mister Hyde first appeared in ''[[Journey into Mystery]]'' #99 and was created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Don Heck]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=244}}</ref> Mister Hyde is inspired by the 1886 [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|literary character]] by [[Robert Louis Stevenson]].

He has appeared as a regular character in ''Thunderbolts'' since issue #157, and remained with the team after the title transitioned into ''Dark Avengers'' beginning with issue #175.

==Fictional character biography==
Calvin Zabo was born in [[Trenton, New Jersey]]. He was a morally abject but brilliant [[biochemist]] who was fascinated by the effect of hormones on human physiology. One of his favorite stories was [[Robert Louis Stevenson|Stevenson]]'s 1886 classic, ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde]]''. He was convinced that the experiment [[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll]] performed in the story could actually be accomplished and became obsessed with the idea of unleashing his full bestial nature in a superhuman form. However, he needed money to do this, so he robbed his various employers systematically. Though too intelligent to be caught, the medical community was suspicious of his tendency to always be employed by organizations which were subsequently robbed. Zabo eventually sought work as a [[surgeon]] in a hospital where [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Donald Blake]] was a directing [[physician]], yet Blake would not allow him a job due to his history. Zabo was enraged that Blake would not give him the position, even though he did ''indeed'' intend to rob the organization, and swore revenge. He was eventually successful in creating his formula and turned into a huge, [[Hulk]]-like creature he called Mister Hyde, named after the character in the novel. In this new form, he found he had superhuman strength enabling him to crush cars and tear through steel as though it were made of cardboard. With his new superhuman powers he sought out Blake, whom he tried to kill by throwing him from a window, but Blake transformed into Thor by striking his cane on the wall and survived, with Thor claiming he had saved Blake. Hyde, hearing of this on the radio, decided to eliminate Thor and tried to frame him for a bank robbery by using his superhuman strength to tear open a bank vault while disguised as Thor. While Blake and [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] were out, Hyde met and kidnapped them at gunpoint. As Blake, Thor was tied up next to a bomb that would explode in 24 hours unless Hyde defused it. However, when attempting to steal a Polaris submarine to roam the seas like a pirate, Hyde was defeated and the authorities, seeing his superhuman strength, realized he must have impersonated Thor, but Thor was forced to allow him to escape, as Jane thought Blake was still in danger.<ref name="Journey into Mystery #99-100">''Journey into Mystery'' #99-100. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hyde went into business as a full-time professional supervillain and teamed up with the [[Cobra (Marvel Comics)|Cobra]] to get revenge upon Thor, but they were both defeated, despite getting Thor's hammer from him briefly.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #105-106. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the Cobra, he was bailed out and employed by [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]] to kidnap Jane Foster and they battled Thor again.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Comtois |first1=Pierre |title=Marvel Comics in the 1960s: An Issue By Issue Field Guide to a Pop Culture Phenomenon |date=2015 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1-60549-016-8 |pages=69–70}}</ref> Loki doubled their powers to try to help them. Loki showed Thor where Jane was being held. The house had many traps set up for Thor, and Jane was almost killed in an explosion. Thor was able to defeat both villains, and Hyde was caught by a ray which paralyzed him. Both Hyde and the Cobra were jailed and Jane's life was saved by an Asgardian formula [[Balder (comics)|Balder]] sent to Thor.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #110-111. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hyde and the Cobra escaped prison, but were eventually recaptured by [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #30-32. Marvel Comics.</ref> They teamed with the [[Jester (Marvel Comics)#Jonathan Powers|Jester]] to get revenge, but were defeated again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #61. Marvel Comics.</ref> With the [[Mac Gargan|Scorpion]], Hyde then battled [[Captain America]] and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].<ref>''Captain America'' #151-152. Marvel Comics.</ref> Teaming with the Cobra again, Hyde attempted to acquire Cagliostro's serum.<ref>''Daredevil'' #142-143. Marvel Comics.</ref> While serving in prison following this failed attempt, Hyde was ensnared by the mind-control power of the [[Purple Man]], and forced to battle Daredevil in an arena alongside the Cobra, the Jester and the [[Gladiator (Melvin Potter)|Gladiator]].<ref>''Daredevil'' #153-154. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Tiring of their repeated failures, the Cobra elected to sever their partnership when he escaped from Ryker's Island, taking the time to taunt Hyde before leaving.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #46. Marvel Comics.</ref> For a long time, Hyde never forgave him for the slight. With [[Batroc the Leaper]], Hyde later blackmailed New York City with a hijacked supertanker and attempted to destroy the entire city in order to kill the Cobra. Eventually, he was defeated by Captain America with Batroc's aid.<ref>''Captain America'' #251-252. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hyde again stalked the Cobra seeking revenge, and this time battled [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #231-232. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was imprisoned again, but escaped Ryker's Island and battled Spider-Man and the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] during another attempt on the Cobra's life.<ref>''Peter Parker, the Spectacular Spider-Man'' #88. Marvel Comics.</ref> Hyde later battled Daredevil again.<ref>''Daredevil'' #235. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hyde later became a member of [[Helmut Zemo|Baron Helmut Zemo]]'s incarnation of the [[Masters of Evil]] and invaded [[Avengers Mansion]] along with them, torturing the [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Black Knight]] and [[Edwin Jarvis]]. With [[Erik Josten|Goliath]] and the [[Wrecking Crew (comics)|Wrecking Crew]], he nearly killed [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]], but was defeated by the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''The Avengers'' #273-276. Marvel Comics.</ref>Hyde later attempted an escape from the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]] alongside [[Mary MacPherran|Titania]], [[Vibro (comics)|Vibro]], the [[Griffin (Marvel Comics)|Griffin]], and the [[Armadillo (comics)|Armadillo]], but was defeated and recaptured by the [[Captain America|Captain]].<ref>''Iron Man'' #228 and ''Captain America'' #340. Marvel Comics.</ref> He eventually escaped from the Vault alongside the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]] and others.<ref>''Avengers Spotlight'' #26</ref> Hyde was later defeated in single combat by the Cobra, who earned Hyde's respect as a result.<ref>''Captain America'' #365-367. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hyde later fought with the [[Hulk|Grey Hulk]] and received head trauma that limited his ability to transform.<ref>''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2 #368. Marvel Comics.</ref> He was subsequently caught by the police when he coincidentally checked into the same hotel as the one where the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' staff were attending [[Robbie Robertson (comics)|Robbie Robertson]]'s retirement party, allowing Peter Parker to defeat him using an improvised costume.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #433</ref> Shortly after, Hyde had several run-ins with the [[Ghost Rider (Danny Ketch)|Ghost Rider]] in which he was defeated with the [[Ghost Rider (Daniel Ketch)#Powers and abilities|Penance Stare]].<ref>''Ghost Rider'' vol. 3 #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hyde briefly helped the [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]-bonded [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]] track the Cobra after a prison escape by providing a piece of skin for the symbiote to track with.<ref>''Toxin'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Zabo was being held in the Raft (the Ryker's Island Prison complex) 6 months after the events of "[[Avengers Disassembled]]."<ref>''Alias'' #26</ref> When a prison break was caused by [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], Zabo emerged in his Hyde persona, fought with Daredevil, and was knocked unconscious by [[Luke Cage]].<ref>''The New Avengers'' #1-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

At one point, Zabo was discovered by the [[Young Avengers]] to be selling a derivative of his Hyde formula on the street as one of the various illegal substances known as Mutant Growth Hormone.<ref>''Young Avengers'' #7-8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Zabo grafts abilities similar to the powers of Spider-Man to homeless teenagers. After Spider-Man revealed his identity during the "[[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]]" storyline, Zabo sought to recreate the circumstances of Spider-Man's "birth", by taking in orphans off the street, imbuing them with spider-powers, and seeing whether or not the teenagers would give in to their darker impulses. During the ensuing battle with Spider-Man, Hyde pulled webbing off his face, taking his eyelids with it, and was hit in the face with hydrochloric acid, courtesy of one of his own Guinea pigs. It is stated by Spider-Man that he has been left blinded and had his face ruined as a result. [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Curt Connors]] was later seen aiding Spider-Man in a cure for Calvin, one of Zabo's test subjects.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #35-37. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hyde's daughter is [[Daisy Johnson]], who is a member of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]; her mother was apparently a sex worker whose services Calvin Zabo frequented and the girl was put up for adoption after birth. Daisy subsequently manifested superpowers inherited from Zabo's mutated genetic code.<ref>''Secret War'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The [[Hood (comics)|Hood]] hired him as part of his criminal organization to take advantage of the split in the superhero community caused by the [[Registration acts (comics)#2006 Superhuman Registration Act|Superhuman Registration Act]].<ref>''The New Avengers'' #35. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, he was seen with Cobra (who was now operating as King Cobra), [[Firebrand (Marvel Comics)#Firebrand|Firebrand]] and the [[Mauler (comics)|Mauler]], who attacked Yellowjacket, the Constrictor and other Initiative staff and trainees.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hyde worked with [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], [[Tiger Shark (Marvel Comics)|Tiger Shark]], and [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] to manipulate [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] III into procuring [[Norman Osborn]]'s fortunes. This was thwarted by Venom and [[Green Goblin]] as Osborn threw a bomb into Hyde's mouth, causing him to spit out blood. Osborn then warned Hyde and the other villains that if they ever cross him again, he will kill everyone that they ever loved before they are tortured to death.<ref>''Thunderbolts: Reasons in Madness'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hyde joins the [[Grim Reaper (comics)|Grim Reaper]]'s new [[Lethal Legion]], claiming embarrassment over Norman Osborn blowing a bomb up in his mouth.<ref>''Dark Reign: Lethal Legion'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hyde appears as a member of the Hood's crime syndicate during an attack on the [[The New Avengers (comics)|New Avengers]].<ref>''The New Avengers'' #56. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Hyde was selected to be a part of the "beta team" of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]], alongside [[Boomerang (comics)|Boomerang]], the [[Shocker (comics)|Shocker]], [[Gunna (comics)|Gunna]] and [[Centurius]].<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #156-157. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, Hyde began a drug operation in California where he came into conflict with [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Robbie Reyes]] after his car had some of Hyde's pills inside. Hyde's mercenaries chase Robbie down during the race in order to retrieve the car and the pills. Robbie is gunned down by the mercenaries when he mistakes them for police and they torch the scene. Robbie is revived as a demonic being called the [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Ghost Rider]] who sports a flaming helmet-like head. In this form, Robbie drives off in the car, now similarly ablaze. The Ghost Rider defeats a few mercenaries and soon disappears in an explosion.<ref>''All-New Ghost Rider'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Robbie eventually fights and defeats Zabo, becoming something of a local hero and urban legend.<ref>''All-New Ghost Rider'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref> Having regrouped and refined his Hyde formula into new blue pills, Calvin Zabo gradually takes over the L.A. criminal underground with his "Blue Hyde Brigade", which includes Guero and his gang, longtime enemies of Robbie, calling themselves the "Blue Krüe."<ref>''All-New Ghost Rider'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Avengers: Standoff!]]" storyline, Hyde was an inmate of Pleasant Hill, a [[gated community]] established by S.H.I.E.L.D.<ref>''Avengers Standoff: Assault on Pleasant Hill Alpha'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Mister Hyde was knocked out by [[Warwolf (Marvel Comics)|Warwolf]].<ref>''[[Howling Commandos of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "Opening Salvo" part of the ''[[Secret Empire (comics)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, Hyde is recruited by Baron Helmut Zemo to join the Army of Evil.<ref>''Captain America: Steve Rogers'' #16. Marvel Comics.</ref> During HYDRA's takeover of the United States, Hyde is one of a few Army of Evil members not in a stasis pod and is shown leading a group of HYDRA soldiers to invade New Attilan and capture the Inhumans.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> He, alongside HYDRA's Avengers, catch his daughter Daisy and her team, the [[Secret Warriors (2017 series)|Secret Warriors]]. During interrogation, Daisy uses her powers to destroy the Helicarrier they are in, forcing Hyde to retreat.<ref>''Secret Warriors'' #3-4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The process that transforms Dr. Calvin Zabo into his Mister Hyde persona is a hormonal transformation caused by ingestion of a chemical formula.<ref>''The Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #37</ref> As his body adjusted to its new form, Hyde's strength, stamina, durability, and resistance to physical injury all increased to superhuman levels. Hyde's powers are sufficient enough that he can stand toe-to-toe with the likes of [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and survive. He has been shown tearing apart a steel bank vault door with ease.<ref>''Journey into Mystery'' #99-100</ref> Through further experimental procedures over the years, his strength has been increased beyond its original limits. Hyde must ingest his special chemical formula periodically to maintain his ability to transform himself from one identity to the other at will; mental fatigue or injury can impair his ability to transform himself into Hyde. He employs a device that resembles a wristwatch that contains a supply of the formula that he can use to deliver it directly into his bloodstream, enabling him to transform at the push of a button.

Due to the nature of the transformation, Hyde's skin is warped. This gives his face a distorted look reminiscent of the [[Lon Chaney, Sr.]] [[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)#Makeup|make-up]] used in ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1925 film)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''.

Dr. Calvin Zabo is a brilliant medical research scientist with a Ph.D. in [[medicine]] and extensive knowledge of [[biochemistry]]. These skills are lost when he assumes his Hyde persona.

==Other versions==
===''Age of Apocalypse''===
In the timeline of the ''[[Age of Apocalypse]]'' storyline, Mister Hyde (as well as the Cobra) is a near-feral and cannibal "scavenger". He is known to prowl graveyards and attack anyone entering his territory.<ref>''Tales From The Age of Apocalypse'' #2 (December 1997). Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Elseworlds''===
Mister Hyde appeared in the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' crossover comic book ''[[Daredevil/Batman: Eye for an Eye]]''. [[Two-Face]] partnered with Hyde for a series of technological robberies. In truth, Two-Face had implanted Hyde's brain with the material needed to "grow" an experimental "organic" computer chip and fed Hyde pills to keep him enraged. Once grown, the chip would kill Hyde, its current growth also weakening Hyde's strength as his energy is diverted to support the chip (Batman noting during the fight that Hyde should normally have a punch that could knock [[Superman]] into orbit). Hyde berates Two-Face, proud he has abandoned his past as Zabo and insults Two-Face for hanging onto his Harvey Dent side, as well as using a coin to decide between right and wrong. Two-Face is glad the process will kill Hyde. In the end, Daredevil uses his past friendship with Dent to talk Two-Face into supplying the antidote for the chip, which saves Hyde's life.<ref>''Daredevil/Batman: Eye for an Eye'' (1997).
