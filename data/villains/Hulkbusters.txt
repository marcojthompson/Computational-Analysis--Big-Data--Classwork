'''Hulkbusters''' is the name of three [[fiction]]al organizations appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. All three groups exist within Marvel's [[shared universe]] known as the [[Marvel Universe]] and are so-named for their attempts to battle the [[Hulk]].

==Fictional history==

===The U.S. military's Hulkbusters===
The original Hulkbusters were a large joint [[task force]] consisting of both U.S. Army and Air Force personnel, whose primary purpose was to capture or if necessary, destroy the Hulk. Their headquarters was the Hulkbuster Base in New Mexico, resembling a [[peace symbols#The peace sign|peace sign]] (also known as [[Gamma Base]]), after it was damaged by the Hulk,{{Issue|date=November 2009}} and they were commanded by General [[Thunderbolt Ross|"Thunderbolt" Ross]], General [[John Ryker|Ryker]] and Major [[Glenn Talbot]]. Hulkbuster Base was later demolished by the [[U-Foes]].<ref>''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' #277 (Nov 1982)</ref> After Bruce Banner, the Hulk's alter-ego, achieved a state in which his normal intelligence and personality remained dominant while in Hulk form, he received a presidential pardon and the Hulkbusters were disbanded.<ref>''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' #279 (Jan 1983)</ref>

While this operation was active, [[Clay Quartermain]] was the [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] liaison to the Hulkbusters operation.

Gamma Base, located in [[Death Valley]], is dedicated to the capturing and curing of the Incredible Hulk.

Originally, Gamma Base was Project Greenskin: Hulkbuster Base and it was the base for the Hulkbusters. The US Government shut it down and it was opened again for Bruce Banner's Project: Hulkbuster.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} When that group broke up, it was shut down again.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} Once again it was re-opened for the use of Operation: Zero Tolerance.{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

===Bruce Banner's Hulkbusters===
After the Hulk reverted to his bestial personality, he was captured by [[Doc Samson]].<ref>''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' #314 (Dec 1985)</ref> Samson persuaded the government to rebuild and finance Gamma Base. There, Samson managed to separate Banner and the Hulk into two distinct beings, although the Hulk was able to escape.<ref>''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' #315 (Jan 1986)</ref> Banner was named the leader of this iteration of the Hulkbusters,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #317</ref> which first appeared in ''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' #317, created by [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] (Mar 1986).<ref>''[[Hulk|Incredible Hulk]]'' #317 (Mar 1986)</ref>

Members of this group of Hulkbusters included:

* '''Craig Saunders, Jr.''' – Demolition expert (later known as Redeemer)
* '''Carolyn Parmenter''' – Marine scientist
* '''Samuel J. La Roquette''' – Explorer (later known as Rock)
* '''Armand Martel''' – Xenobiologist
* '''Hideko Takata''' – Geophysics professor

Saunders, Jr. and La Roquette later became '''Rock and Redeemer''', a supervillain team who faced the Hulk on various occasions,<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #345</ref><ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #366</ref><ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #398</ref> after much of Banner's HB team were slain in Hulk's destruction.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' #343</ref> Rock had an external hide made of deadly minerals which can be used to impale and grow in size. Redeemer had an exoskeletal suit with weapons like repulsor blasters, and rocket fuel. [[Leader (comics)|The Leader]] later recruited them into "New Freehold" along with the [[Riot Squad (comics)|Riot Squad]],{{Issue|date=September 2009}} and they haven't been seen since.

===S.H.I.E.L.D.'s Hulkbusters===
Hulk's exile from Earth by the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] brought forth an unexpected consequence: Hulk's rogues' gallery began running wild. As a result, [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] formed a team called the Hulkbusters to capture these villains and implant them with nanotechnology to nullify their powers.<ref>''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #106</ref> The team was led by Agent Clay Quartermain and members included Agent Cheesecake, Agent Crimson, and [[She-Hulk]].
