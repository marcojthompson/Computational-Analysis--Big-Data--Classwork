Having staged a coup of New York after spreading his resources by exploiting the Superior Spider-Man's reliance on technology, the Goblin King directly confronts the Superior Spider-Man, angry that he was cheated out of the opportunity to defeat his nemesis, but offering the Superior Spider-Man the chance to join him and the former rejects the offer.

In hiding once again, he reflects that the various heroes will be unprepared for him when he returns with his new identity and approach as a businessman, seemingly no longer afflicted by the mental illness associated with the Goblin formula.<ref>''Superior Spider-Man'' #31.
