'''Ogun''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[Japan]]ese [[supervillain]] in the [[Marvel Comics]] [[Marvel Universe|universe]] and a foe of [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. His first appearance was in ''[[Kitty Pryde and Wolverine]]'' #2 (Dec 1984), and was scripted by [[Chris Claremont]] and drawn by [[Allen Milgrom]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=261}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==
Ogun was a [[ninja]] and [[martial arts]] master who acted as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s mentor. Very little is known of his past or the exact nature of his abilities, but he was apparently a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who could possess and control minds via [[telepathy]]. His reflexes and reaction time also appear to have been enhanced beyond the range attainable by normal humans, such as that he was easily a match for Wolverine. Note that either or both of these abilities may have been wholly or partially [[Mysticism|mystical]] in nature.<ref>''Wolverine'' #50</ref>

Ogun first met Wolverine in [[Shanghai]], [[China]]. Shanghai was held by the [[Empire of Japan]], following the [[Battle of Shanghai (1937)|Battle of Shanghai]] in the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945). Ogun was reportedly active in the War as a [[Captain (OF-2)|captain]] of the [[Imperial Japanese Army]]. Wolverine was only a wandering [[sailor]] but managed to draw the attention of the captain who would seek his acquaintance. The issue was scripted by [[Larry Hama]] and drawn by [[Leinil Francis Yu]].<ref>''Wolverine'' #113 (May 1997)</ref>

At some point in the past, Ogun fell from the path of honor and was a criminal enforcer for the [[Yakuza]]. Ogun mentally possessed [[Kitty Pryde]] trained as a ninja, and attempted to turn her into an assassin. Under Wolverine's care, however, Kitty recovered and resisted another brainwashing attempt, and Wolverine was eventually forced to kill Ogun.<ref>''Kitty Pryde and Wolverine'' #1-6</ref>

Years later, Ogun returned as a disembodied spirit, mentally possessing host after host, and again attacked Wolverine and Kitty. With [[Ghost Rider (Johnny Blaze)|Ghost Rider]]'s help, Wolverine figured out that to destroy Ogun involved only destroy Ogun's enchanted mask (apparently he had several as the first was already destroyed). Ogun was thus destroyed, ''seemingly'' for good.<ref>''Wolverine'' #89</ref>

Later, Ogun returned yet again, this time travelling from host body to host body, and he even tried to take over [[Lady Deathstrike]]'s body. Wolverine found a way to force him out of all available host bodies and into the body of [[Viper (Marvel Comics)|Viper]] who Wolverine impaled (non-lethally). Panicking, Ogun jumped from Viper's body but having no form to inhabit, seemed to evaporate away.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

But as seen somewhat later, Ogun even survived that and tried to take his revenge on Pryde and Wolverine by luring the two onboard of the Hellicarrier he was able to control through the cyberpathy advancements he learned while taking over Lady Deathstrike, but once again he was defeated. It is not known what happened after Kitty managed to convince him of the error of his ways inside the astral plane.<ref>''Kitty Pryde, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1-3</ref>

Ogun's clan is now shown to be run by Sojobo and Karasu, a pair of psychic twins he had adopted as a son and daughter prior to his demise. The children are rescued from this brutal existence by [[David Haller]] who shows them that they don't have to follow in their father's murderous footsteps.<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' (vol. 2) #3</ref> After a skirmish with the [[X-Men]], the twins are then taken to the [[Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].<ref>''X-Men Legacy'' (vol. 2) #4</ref>

Ogun's spirit later resurfaces and tries to possess Kitty once more before his host manages to drive him out. It's also revealed that Ogun had murdered [[Cyber (Marvel Comics)|Cyber]] in an attempt to sell the villain's [[adamantium]]-laced corpse to [[Abraham Cornelius]].<ref>''Death of Wolverine'' #3</ref>

Ogun's spirit possessed the fighter Shogun.<ref>''Wolverines'' #1-20</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The extent and nature of Ogun's powers was never fully revealed. He demonstrated the ability to control minds and could remove his spirit from his body and place in a new host (submerging that host body's personality). His original body also seemed to be somewhat resistant to injury, although Wolverine managed to kill him. Ogun was able to survive impalement through the torso by a sword thrust with no apparent ill-effects. His reflexes and agility were heightened beyond normal human levels. It is implied that Ogun was a telepath who also had some mystical powers, but this was never clearly specified. In life, Ogun was also apparently capable of slowing or completely halting his aging; a legend is mentioned where he had once a duel of wills with the Japanese swordmaster [[Miyamoto Musashi]].<ref>''Kitty Pryde and Wolverine'' #4</ref>

==In other media==
===Television===
Ogun makes his animated debut in the ''[[Wolverine and the X-Men (TV series)|Wolverine and the X-Men]]'' animated series, voiced by [[James Sie]].{{cn|date=October 2019}} This version is depicted as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]'s sensei rather than an immortal ninja. In the episode "Code of Conduct", his memory is used by [[Professor X]] to help refresh Logan's samurai skills. 

===Film===
An original character named '''Ichirō Yashida''' appears in ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'',<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=80099 |title=SDCC: Hugh Jackman Confirms The Wolverine Villain |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=2011-07-21 |access-date=2016-02-18}}</ref> with [[Haruhiko Yamanouchi]] portraying his older self and [[Ken Yamamura]] portraying his younger self.<ref>{{cite web|last=Trumbore |first=Dave |url=http://collider.com/wolverine-cast/178330/ |title=WOLVERINE Adds Japanese Actors |publisher=Collider |access-date=2016-02-17}}</ref> An amalgamation of Ogun and the [[Silver Samurai]] from the comics, Yashida is the founder of the Yashida Clan's technology empire, [[Shingen Yashida]]'s father, [[Mariko Yashida]]'s grandfather, and [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]]'s foster father. As a young man in the Japanese military during WWII, Yashida was saved by [[Logan (film series character)|Logan]] during the United States' [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombing of Nagasaki]] and became obsessed with the latter's healing factor and immortality. As an old man dying of cancer in the present, Yashida arranges for Logan to see him one more time and asks Mariko to succeed him instead of Shingen before seemingly dying. In reality, Yashida faked his death and tasked [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]] with helping him develop a [[Silver Samurai|giant robotic suit]] made of [[adamantium]] armed with a [[katana]] and [[wakazashi]] capable of being super-heated in order to sustain himself and steal Logan's powers. After eliminating his enforcer [[Kenuichio Harada]] for betrayal, Yashida uses his adamantium weapons to sever Logan's adamantium claws and extract his healing factor. However, Mariko uses the claws to attack Yashida who loses control of his suit while Logan regenerates his original bone claws and kills him.

===Toys===
The Series 6 Wolverine figure from ToyBiz's Marvel Legends line came with a display base that featured Ogun.
