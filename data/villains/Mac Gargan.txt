'''MacDonald "Mac" Gargan''' is a <!--Do not add "fictional" as it is tautological; supervillains (and characters in general) are by definition implied to be fictionalized to some extent.-->[[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is usually depicted as an adversary of the [[superhero]] [[Spider-Man]]. Created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], he first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #19 (December 1964) as a [[private investigator]] hired by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to learn how Peter Parker took pictures of Spider-Man. In the following issue, Jameson decided to turn Gargan into a deadly adversary for Spider-Man through a barely-tested procedure, which left Gargan with an unremovable [[scorpion]]-themed armor and the predatory instincts of the arachnid. Driven insane by his mutation, Gargan instead turned to a life of crime as the [[Scorpion (Marvel Comics)|'''Scorpion''']], and went on to menace both Spider-Man and Jameson, whom he held responsible for his transformation. Since then, Gargan has also served as the third host of the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|'''Venom''']] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], and a member of the [[Dark Avengers]] as '''Spider-Man''', but eventually returned to his Scorpion alias.

Since his debut during the [[Silver Age of Comic Books]], the character has featured in various Marvel-endorsed products and media adaptations, such as [[feature films]], [[television series]] and [[video games]]. Gargan made his live-action debut in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017), portrayed by [[Michael Mando]]. The character is among Spider-Man's more popular rogues, and has been ranked by [[IGN]] as his 10th greatest enemy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 25 Spider-Man Villains|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/top-25-spider-man-villains|website=IGN}}</ref>

==Fictional character biography==

===Scorpion===
Mac Gargan was a [[private investigator]] initially hired by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to find out how Peter Parker is able to obtain incredible pictures of [[Spider-Man]].<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Brevoort |first1=Tom |last2=DeFalco |first2=Tom |last3=Manning |first3=Matthew K. |last4=Sanderson |first4=Peter |last5=Wiacek |first5=Win |title=Marvel Year By Year: A Visual History |date=2017 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1465455505 |page=106}}</ref> Gargan's efforts set off Peter's spider-sense and the teen easily evades the detective. Jameson then decides to hire Gargan as the subject of a barely-tested process that would endow him with the useful characteristics of a particular animal with the help of Dr. [[Farley Stillwell]]. Dr. Stillwell also outfits him with a club-like mechanical tail. In this case, a [[scorpion]] is the base for the purposes of creating a powerful agent capable of defeating Spider-Man as the scorpion is a natural predator of the spider. The Scorpion proves to be more than a match for Spider-Man, defeating him twice, but the mutagenic treatment seriously affects Gargan's mind, driving him insane as the predatory instincts of the scorpion take over. He promptly turns on his benefactor but Spider-Man intervenes, and finally defeats the Scorpion in their third battle.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20">''Amazing Spider-Man'' #20.

Scorpion learns that Spider-Man survived the encounter, and the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] gives him the hero's location. The Scorpion arrives at a hospital room with Peter Parker and his [[Aunt May]]. Not recognizing Spider-Man in his civilian identity, he threatens May and demands to know where Spider-Man is.

Marvel Comics.</ref> Despite his encounters with other foes, Scorpion has always had a special hatred for Spider-Man and Jameson, which extends to when he attempts to become a mercenary for [[Justin Hammer]], who has the Scorpion's battlesuit modified. He ruins his prospects on his first mission, to capture a war hero, when he cannot resist creating a [[hostage situation]] simply to bring Jameson to him for revenge. In reaction, while Spider-Man in cooperation with the police are dealing with Gargan, Hammer sends [[Blacklash]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to subdue Gargan and confiscate the tail enhancement equipment for abrogating his contract.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #318-319.

{{Main|Venom (Marvel Comics character)}}
Later on, through circumstances yet to be revealed, [[Norman Osborn]] reveals Spider-Man's true identity to Gargan and gives him orders to kidnap Peter's Aunt May should Osborn ever be captured and imprisoned. When Spider-Man defeats Osborn, he is imprisoned and Gargan carries out Osborn's orders in kidnapping Aunt May. Gargan eventually summons Peter and tells him the only way he can see his aunt again is to break Norman out of jail. Shortly thereafter, the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote approaches Gargan,<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #9. Marvel Comics.</ref> offering him new abilities, and Gargan becomes bonded with the creature.{{issue|date=September 2018}} This would later give him an extra edge as part of Norman Osborn's [[Sinister Six|Sinister Twelve]].<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> Even with these additional powers he is still swiftly defeated by Spider-Man, as [[Captain America]], [[Iron Man]], [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], [[Hank Pym|Yellowjacket]] and the [[Fantastic Four]] deal with the rest of the Twelve.<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #11. Marvel Comics.</ref> Though incarcerated,<ref>''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gargan is unfazed, as with his new powers come the respect of becoming an "A-list" villain at last.{{issue|date=September 2018}}

Alongside Spider-Man and other villains and heroes, Venom is [[Beyond!|kidnapped by other-dimensional forces]]. He succeeds in killing Spider-Man, who is really the original [[Space Phantom]] in disguise.<ref>''Beyond!'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> For his crimes, the [[Inhumans]] matriarch [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] orders his execution and almost carries it out herself. Later, he tries to kill the other participants for the [[Beyonder]]'s wish fulfillment prize for the winner,<ref>''Beyond!'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> but fails and is returned to Earth alongside the rest of the group.<ref>''Beyond!'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Thunderbolts===
Gargan later becomes a member of a sub-group of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]],<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> which has been drafted by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive Secret Avengers and is currently run by the Commission for Superhuman Activities.<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Choosing Sides]]'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is then revealed that he has been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the Venom symbiote in check.<ref>''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> As a Thunderbolt, he is seen as a hero by the general public and has his own action figures.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #110. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gargan displays his new raw power as Venom in a battle with [[Jack Flag]], after pummeling Flag for a bit, the hero manages to stab Gargan, who is protected by the symbiote. Gargan becomes enraged and ferociously man-handles Flag, and is about to eat him when his electrical implants kick in and temporarily subdue him, allowing Flag to live.<ref name="Thunderbolts #111">''Thunderbolts'' #111. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gargan expresses fear of the control the symbiote possesses over him, yet he has become addicted to the raw unearthly power it brings to him and cannot even begin to imagine life without it, similar to a drug addict.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #112. Marvel Comics.</ref> An attack from [[Steel Spider]] and [[Shadowoman|Sepulchre]] makes him lose control again, briefly becoming a huge monster once more, while Moonstone is incapacitated and thus cannot coordinate control of his electrical implants.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #114. Marvel Comics.</ref> Afterwards he returns to a normal form with no ill effects. He also bites off and devours Steel Spider's arm during a fight.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #115. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gargan is later ordered by Osborn to hunt down [[Namor]]. After shooting him with a Thunderbolts-supplied weapon, Gargan disables Namor by ripping off his feet-wings. The Sub-Mariner manages to render Gargan unconscious and then rips out the symbiote's tongue,<ref>''[[Sub-Mariner]]'' #3</ref> although the symbiote easily makes a new one. Gargan begins to hallucinate that the symbiote is speaking to him, telling him to "feed (it)". He later attacks and devours a guard and declares that "the only way out of Thunderbolts Mountain is when I decide to let you die".<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #118. Marvel Comics.</ref> It is later revealed that the psychic criminal [[Blue Streak (comics)#Bluestreak (psychic)|Bluestreak]] is controlling Gargan's actions, although it is uncertain whether the symbiote was actually speaking to him or not.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #119. Marvel Comics.</ref> Venom goes up against the [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], who stabs Gargan through the chest, using his powers to force the symbiote away from his sword. Gargan is wounded, but lives.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #120. Marvel Comics.</ref> After healing, he retains his monstrous form, rarely returning to his usual size.

==="New Ways to Die"===
Gargan reappears during the "New Ways to Die" story arc of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', no longer possessing the knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=16246 |title=CBR News: Enemies at the Gates: Wacker Talks "Amazing Spider-Man" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |access-date=2011-02-08}}</ref> Gargan and the Thunderbolts are called back to New York to capture Spider-Man. While on a search for the wall-crawler, Gargan's symbiote senses a former host nearby. Gargan suspects that it is Spider-Man but instead finds [[Eddie Brock]] at the F.E.A.S.T center (a soup kitchen). The Venom symbiote attempts to leave Gargan to re-bond with Brock, much to Gargan's (and Brock's) dismay. Upon making contact with Brock, his skin is shown to be caustic to his former symbiote, and as a white substance seeps out of his pores covering his body, Brock uses the [[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]] symbiote and battles Gargan. With some help from Spider-Man, Anti-Venom subdues Venom and nearly destroys the symbiote.<ref>{{Comic book reference| writer=[[Dan Slott]]| penciller=[[John Romita Jr.]]| story="New Ways to Die"|title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]| volume=| issue=#569| date=August 2008|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| page=| panel=}}</ref> Norman Osborn uses a sample of Anti-Venom's DNA from Mac Gargan and creates a poisonous counter to its healing powers by combining the sample with the immune system of [[Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]]. Mac Gargan is injected with the "cure" and is given a new Scorpion battlesuit, which contains the venom, until the symbiote can recover.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #572. Marvel Comics.</ref> Anti-Venom tracks down Gargan at Oscorp. After a grueling battle "Ven-orpion" injects the toxin into Anti-Venom and seemly kills the suit. He then attempts to kill Brock but the symbiote tries holding him back, still feeling love for its former host. The symbiote gains its strength and breaks though the Scorpion suit. Gargan gives up but promises that he will get past this problem and will someday finish Brock.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #573. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Secret Invasion''===
Gargan was seen being thrown from Thunderbolt Mountain by [[Captain Marvel (Khn'nr)|Captain Marvel]].<ref>''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #3</ref> Gargan was later seen with the other Thunderbolts in Washington. The [[Skrull]]s attempt to trick him into killing normal humans in order to find out which of them are Skrulls.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #123. Marvel Comics.</ref> Osborn attempted to prevent the symbiote from killing anyone by threatening to kill Mac Gargan and promising to help satisfy his "urges" later, only for Gargan to reveal that the threat he appeared to pose to civilians was a ruse in order to draw out a disguised Skrull. Venom played a huge part in fighting the Skrulls. He was seen slashing and eating the Skrulls all at once.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #124. Marvel Comics.</ref> He soon joins the Thunderbolts and the remaining heroes for the final battle against the Skrulls. During the battle, he was a force to be reckoned with.<ref>''Secret Invasion'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Venom, along with most of the Thunderbolts team, attempts to kill partner [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] on the orders of Osborn. Facing Venom, Songbird was defeated and almost eaten by Venom, but escaped with help from the Swordsman.<ref>''Thunderbolts'' #127. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Dark Reign''===
<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dark Reign Sinister Spider-Man.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mac Gargan as Spider-Man. Art By [[Mike Deodato Jr]].]] -->
Norman Osborn forms the [[Dark Avengers]], providing new identities to some of his former Thunderbolts. After feeding a [[Skrull]] to a hungry Venom that has become more bestial than human, Osborn gives him a medication that resets the symbiote to the size it was when it possessed Spider-Man originally. Gargan can transform into his larger Venom form at will.

Norman introduces Gargan and the symbiote as "[[Alternative versions of Spider-Man#Prime Earth (Earth-616)|Spider-Man]]" of the Dark Avengers.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> During their first mission against [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgana le Fay]], Morgana transforms "Venom-Spidey" into a giant, demonic monster who then tries to eat [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> Venom later coughs up Ares; however, Morgana's magic continues to affect Venom, causing him to lose and gain control of himself randomly.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> After Morgana is defeated in the past by Iron Patriot and [[Doctor Doom]], Mac returned to his "Spider-Man" form with only a slight headache. [[Bullseye (comics)|Hawkeye]] promised to kill Mac one day for trying to eat him while he was under Morgana's control.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Once they arrive home, he is seen arguing with Hawkeye.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Later, attempting to find out Norman Osborn's plans for his son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]], the real Spider-Man, with the aid of the [[Invisible Woman]], manages to capture Gargan by using a sonic generator and takes his place to infiltrate the Dark Avengers. Gargan is thrown into the [[Negative Zone]],<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #596. Marvel Comics.</ref> but is later seen back with the Dark Avengers.

Against Osborn's wishes, Gargan is seen heading out into the city to "fight crime" solo. At one point, he is seen defeating a bank robber called General Wolfram. After making out with two girls at once and getting cheered by a large crowd, he takes the robber to an abandoned rooftop and consumes his arm. He then takes the money Wolfram stole and swings away. Gargan is then seen at a [[strip club]] with the money and discovers his new favorite stripper. After getting reprimanded by Norman Osborn for eating Wolfram's arm, Gargan kills the stripper and places her dead body in J. Jonah Jameson's bed while he is gone in an attempt to frame him for her murder. At the same time, Redeemer visits the injured General Wolfram and recruits him alongside other villains who have had limbs bitten off by Gargan (namely Dementoid, Doctor Everything, Eleven, and [[Hippo (comics)|Hippo]]) in a plan to take down "Spider-Man" (who is believed to be the root of their problem).<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> In another attempt to antagonize Jameson, Gargan instigates a turf war between two rival street gangs, hoping to wear Jameson down through stress and exhaustion from continuously putting out stories to cover the crime wave. At the same time, the Redeemer arms his group with cybernetic limbs to defeat Spider-Man. J. Jonah Jameson goes to Osborn for help and is given Spider-Man to help solve the city's gang problem.<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gargan continues to instigate the gang war and aggravate Jameson in person. A bomb threat is placed by Redeemer to lure Spider-Man into an intervention, though Gargan instead devours Hippo and Eleven, badly injures Dementoid, and beats Doctor Everything into submission before turning him over to the police. He then eats Redeemer's limbs. With Redeemer, Wolfram, and Dementoid the only ones still remaining of the group (albeit hospitalized), Redeemer sends photos of Gargan's actions to Jameson in an attempt to expose him as a cannibalistic psychopath to the world.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref> Jameson first goes to Osborn, who decides to cut Gargan loose by sending Bullseye and [[Daken]] (in their old costumes) to kill him. At the Big Apple Festival, the two attack him, with Dementoid, General Wolfram, and both gangs involved in the turf war entering the fray to try to kill Spider-Man. Gargan ends up defeating all of them, and J. Jonah Jameson shoots a gun in the air to stop the fight. As a result, everyone credits Jameson and Spider-Man with successfully working together to stop criminals and save the festival. Gargan later returns to Avengers Tower, where he is visited by Norman Osborn. Osborn informs him that Bullseye and Daken will get over being hurt, but warns Gargan that if he goes out of control again, he will suit up as the Iron Patriot and take care of him personally.<ref>''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the opening chapter of "[[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]]," the Dark Avengers are sent into San Francisco to quell the mutant riots and battle any X-Men they can find. Tension is shown to exist between the Avengers and Osborn's own [[Dark X-Men]]. When [[Namor]] and [[Emma Frost]] are revealed to be [[double agent]]s on [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops']] side and defect with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], an irate Osborn gathers the Dark Avengers and the remaining Dark X-Men, Gargan included, ordering them to bring him Namor's head and Emma Frost's heart and to make sure that Cyclops sees them do it.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #8. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men attack Utopia and battle the X-Men, with Venom facing off against [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Due to the sheer number of X-Men, Osborn is forced to retreat when informed that the only way to win would be to kill all the mutants on the island, an option which is not politically viable.<ref>''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gargan later begins to show signs that his medications are making him emotionally unstable. On a mission with the Dark Avengers, Osborn takes Gargan off the case when he notices Gargan's outbursts.<ref name="Dark Avengers #10">''Dark Avengers'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> [[Molecule Man]] turns Gargan and his symbiote into an inert pile of goo.<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #11</ref> He is later restored by the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]].<ref>''Dark Avengers'' #12</ref>

==="Siege"===
During the "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]" storyline, Mac Gargan is with the Dark Avengers when Norman Osborn makes plans to invade [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Mac Gargan and the rest of the Avengers protest. For fighting alongside the Initiative, Osborn promises to give the team their freedom from servitude. As a result, Gargan is among the mass of soldiers to launch an attack on Asgard following [[Loki (Marvel Comics)|Loki]]'s setup. He and the rest of the Avengers manage to overwhelm [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]].<ref>''Siege'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> While fighting Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man after they arrive, Gargan is forcefully removed from the Venom symbiote, which takes over Ms. Marvel until Spider-Man defeats it.<ref>''Siege: Spider-Man'' #1. Marvel Coomics.</ref> He, along with the other Dark Avengers, are arrested after Norman Osborn falls from power.<ref>''Siege'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Return as Scorpion===
During the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline, Mac Gargan is seen at the Raft superprison, having been separated from the Venom symbiote: the symbiote's removal was causing medical problems due to the side effects from his original genetic mutation. [[Alistair Smythe]] breaks him out of the Raft.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #650. Marvel Comics.</ref> Gargan was then fitted with a new Scorpion suit by Smythe, which included a life-support system to stabilize Gargan's condition. Smythe convinced Gargan to join him in his plan for revenge on J. Jonah Jameson.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #651">''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #651. Marvel Comics.</ref> Scorpion joins Alistair Smythe, a new villain named Fly-Girl, and some unnamed cyborg minions (each wanting revenge on Jameson) in attacking the launch site of [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s latest space mission, where they sabotage the launch and hold John Jameson for ransom.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #652.

==Characterization==
===Powers and abilities===
====As Scorpion====
Mac Gargan, as the Scorpion, was given superhuman powers through chemical and radiological treatments, include splicing his genetics with a scorpion's DNA, which produced mutagenic effects. As the result, he has [[arachnid]]-like powers similar to Spider-Man's such as superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, and durability, and also can scale walls (he also punches holes in walls as a way to climb). He also has an exceptionally strong grip, reminiscent of a real scorpion's pincers. He wears a full-body battlesuit composed of two layers of light steel mesh separated by a thin layer of insulated rubber. In addition to his superhuman physique, he was traditionally armed with a cybernetically-controlled, seven-foot mechanical tail, with a tool steel articulated framework which can whip at 90 miles per hour. The tail has in the past been equipped with projectile weapons, usually an electric generator, although it has also been equipped with a spike at its tip, which can squirt an acidic spray, and a low-density plasma energy projector. The Scorpion can use his tail as an extra leg, or he can coil it behind him to spring himself a distance of at least 30 feet. The Scorpion is substantially stronger and more durable than Spider-Man, though is a much less skilled hand-to-hand combatant, and thus Spider-Man relies on his tactics and wits to defeat him.

====As Venom====
With the Venom symbiote, Mac Gargan retains his superhuman abilities, some of which have increased substantially beyond the original levels. The costume can even emulate the tail of Gargan's Scorpion costume. It can also be used as a fifth limb.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} As Venom, Gargan has gained the ability to shoot webbing and climb walls like Spider-Man, and can disguise himself as other people or blend in with his background. He is undetectable by Spider-Man's "spider-sense". His skill as a hand-to-hand combatant has increased due to the influence of the alien symbiote, which has superior instincts and fighting experience. The costume can also heal grave injuries suffered by the host with incredible speed. Mac (as Venom) has claws on his fingers which can be used as weapons to slash his foes. He can also create tendrils to incapacitate his enemies.

When injured or enraged, Venom now has the ability to increase its mass and physical strength in order to meet whatever threat it is facing with equal force, an ability inconsistently hinted in the past, such as when Venom battled the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. During these times it is not clear that Gargan has any control over the symbiote, for had it not been for the technology restraining Venom, he would have eaten [[Jack Flag]]. Also, during a battle with the [[Steel Spider]], Gargan attacks innocent bystanders.<ref name="Thunderbolts #111"/>

====As Spider-Man====
A special "medication" provided by Norman Osborn allowed Venom to assume a smaller, more human-looking form similar to when Spider-Man had control of the symbiote. From this form, he is able to switch back to his larger, more feral form whenever he pleases. As Spider-Man, Mac seems to be even more agile than when he was as Venom. He also still has all of Venom's powers, minus the claws, tongue, and teeth, which he can regrow at will.<ref name="ReferenceA"/> His "medication" has also been shown to decrease his will to fight, making him more sympathetic.<ref name="Dark Avengers #10"/>

====Return as Scorpion====
After [[Alistair Smythe|Smythe]] breaks him out of the Raft, Gargan is fitted with a new Scorpion suit. The suit is larger than its predecessor, and cybernetically wired into Gargan, making him a [[cyborg]]. It is equipped with a more powerful tail, mechanical pincers, and is bulletproof. Smythe also altered Gargan's biology, giving him a "scorpion-sense" to match Spider-Man's spider-sense. The suit is also very tough, allowing Gargan to withstand a fall at terminal speed.<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #651"/> The armor leaves Mac's jaw unprotected, which Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body exploited to punch his jaw clean off.<ref name="ReferenceC"/> Following his employment by Alchemax, he has gained a new jaw to replace the jaw he lost.<ref name="auto"/>

===Personality===
Before he assumed the identity of the Scorpion, Mac Gargan was a skilled, if somewhat greedy and unscrupulous, private investigator, who admitted that he would go through anything "just so long as the pay is good!"<ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20"/> His greed still motivated him as a supervillain, albeit in a twisted way: while awaiting an official "offer" from the Thunderbolts, Gargan squeezed his agent for financial details on a proposed book, TV and movie deal ("How many back points? And residuals? Fantastic. That foreign ''and ''domestic?"), demanded certain talent for the writing (including [[Eric Guggenheim|the screenwriting brother]] of [[Marc Guggenheim|the comic's writer]]) and, finally, Gargan killed six "capekiller" [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents sent to bring him in - because while he intended to cooperate, his agent had told him that the rights to his life story would be "worth a little more" if Gargan "goosed up the body count" before joining the Thunderbolts.<ref>''Civil War: Choosing Sides'' #1 (Dec. 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref>

He is emotionally disturbed as a result of the procedure in which he acquired his powers, and retains little of his former rationality. He is typically easily outsmarted by Spider-Man and is not very good at cooperating with other supervillains or following instructions as Justin Hammer learned. His most prominent weakness is his explosive temper and irrational hatred toward J. Jonah Jameson, to the point where he has been known to ignore the orders of whomever he is working for, in order to attack the ''Daily Bugle's'' publisher{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. None of this has changed with his bonding to the Venom symbiote, or with his new career serving under Norman Osborn with the Thunderbolts or the Dark Avengers: in fact, the symbiote seems to have only made him even more irrational, and his new career as a "hero" has done nothing to curtail his lingering hatred of Jameson{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. He nearly blew his cover as Spider-Man when he started a drug war and photographs of him engaging in cannibalism wound up in J. Jonah Jameson's hands, putting his employer [[Norman Osborn]]'s plans and the "heroic" status of his entire [[Dark Avengers]] team in jeopardy, just to pursue vengeance against Jameson (now the Mayor of New York) yet again. His ill-conceived and poorly thought-out plan failed, and he was forced to publicly make peace with Jameson in his Spider-Man guise, greatly embarrassing him, though he secretly fantasized about killing Jameson during the whole time while they were shaking hands{{Issue|date=November 2009}}.

The years of being outsmarted and beaten, despite his physical superiority over Spider-Man, complement the similar hatred possessed by the symbiote, and has allowed it to almost completely control Gargan. Unlike the other Venoms, Mac very seldom refers to himself as "we" instead of "I". Gargan has even engaged in [[cannibalism]] as Venom, severing and devouring the arm of the still-living [[Steel Spider]]. After getting "the taste of flesh", he is seen displaying even more signs of cannibalism such as eating Skrulls, consuming the bones of [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], devouring Eleven and the limbs of criminals, and trying to eat Ares. When the symbiote is dormant in his body he has expressed nausea and fear of the organism.<ref>''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #112. Marvel Comics.</ref> Unlike [[Eddie Brock]], any inhibitions Gargan had about harming innocent bystanders has been eliminated with his bonding to the symbiote, most likely because he had such little regard for others to begin with. Gargan's [[#Scorpion|previous identity]] has not been completely degraded. His [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] once sprouted a scorpion-like tail, although he has not had it since. Also, when he learned there was a [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|new hero]] calling herself the Scorpion, Gargan-Venom attacked her to protect his trademark while it still lasted. Also, for a brief time, Gargan wore a new Scorpion suit while the symbiote regenerated after Anti-Venom's attack, although initially he was hesitant about wearing it alongside the symbiote.

Within the game's continuity, Spider-Man has been a superhero for eight years and is well-familiar with Scorpion. At the beginning of the game's storyline, Scorpion is imprisoned at the maximum security supervillain prison, the [[Raft (comics)|Raft]]. However, he eventually escapes when [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]] stages a prison break and agrees to join his liberator's Sinister Six in exchange for expunging Gargan's criminal record and clearing his gambling debts. After the team overpowers Spider-Man, they split up to attack different Oscorp properties, with Scorpion being sent to poison the city's water reservoir. Though he is foiled by Spider-Man, Scorpion poisons him with his toxin and escapes while the webslinger develops a cure. Scorpion later joins the Rhino at the docks, but Spider-Man arrives to confront them. After turning the villains against each other, Spider-Man locks them inside a shipping container just as the police arrive to take them back into custody.
