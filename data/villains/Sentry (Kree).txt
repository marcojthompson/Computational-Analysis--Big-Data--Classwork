==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=September 2016}}
The Kree Sentries first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]'' vol. 1, #64 (Jul 1967) and were created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Jack Kirby]].

==Fictional character biography==
===Sentry-459===
The Sentries' main purpose is to stand guard over military outposts and depots throughout the Kree Empire. Sentry-459 accompanied a Kree scientific party that journeyed to Earth to experiment on sub-humans (which in turn created the race the [[Inhumans]]). When the Kree left Earth, Sentry-459 remained to monitor Inhuman progress, so that the Kree could later use them as a militia force. Sentry-459 remained inert but observing until activated by the superheroes the [[Fantastic Four]], who fought it to a standstill. Considering itself defeated when the Fantastic Four escaped, the Sentry sent a signal to the Kree alerting them to the presence of meta-humans on Earth and then deactivated itself (the Kree [[Ronan the Accuser]] investigates the signal and battles the Fantastic Four soon after).<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 1 #64 - 65. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Sentry was then transported by the U.S. Army to [[Cape Canaveral]], where it was reactivated by the Kree Colonel [[Yon-Rogg]], the leader of the Kree expedition then investigating Earth. Yon-Rogg hoped the Sentry would kill the hero [[Captain Marvel (Mar-Vell)|Captain Marvel]], another member of expedition. Mar-Vell, however, managed to defeat it.<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' vol. 1 #13 (Mar 1968). Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[Ronan the Accuser]] later reactivated the Sentry and used it in an attempt to reverse the course of evolution on Earth, but it was once again defeated by Mar-Vell.<ref>''Captain Marvel'' vol. 1 #47 - 49. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Kree agents attempt to retrieve the Sentry but are driven off by spy agency [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] The Sentry was seen again when activated by the [[Super-Adaptoid]], who used the robot as part of his team [[Heavy Metal (Marvel Comics)|Heavy Metal]] in a bid to destroy the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]].<ref>''Avengers'' vol. 1 #286 - 290. Marvel Comics.</ref> It returned in the ''[[Blackwulf]]'' series, having been found by [[Ultron]],<ref>as seen in the back-up story in ''Blackwulf'' #3.
