==Publication history==
Created by [[Howard Mackie]], the character first appeared in ''[[Peter Parker: Spider-Man|Spider-Man]]'' vol. 1 #76 (January 1997).

==Fictional character biography==
Loxias Crown was an agent of [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] who tracked down William Fields, a scientist at Empire State University (''ESU''). Arriving at Fields's home on Christmas Eve, Crown slew Fields but let his victim's wife and child escape. Young Todd Fields swore revenge on Crown.<ref name="Spider-Man Vol 1.76" />

Crown abducted [[Morbius the Living Vampire]] to perform experiments. He also tried to take Aiken and fellow ''ESU'' students [[Peter Parker]] and Abby Levin. With a group of Hydra storm troopers, Crown threatened to kill Parker unless Aiken came with him. He teleported Parker and his friend to his secret base.<ref name="Spider-Man Vol 1.79" />

However, [[Hammerhead (comics)|Hammerhead]] killed his love, so Crown took a Hydra airship to his apartment building to get revenge on the gangsters. He took SHOC and prepared to overload his armor, killing them all. He blew Hammerhead away with his [[darkforce]] energy and began to destroy the building. He also took down both SHOC and Spider-Man, but, before he could finish, Morbius attacked him. As the building was destroyed around them, Morbius drained Crown dry, disappearing with his victim in the process.<ref name="Spider-Man Vol 1.80" />

===Hunger===
Now a "Living Vampire" himself, he began living in the sewers beneath the city. He abducted citizens and kept them in his lair beneath the streets. He even took some of the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlocks]], including their leader [[Callisto (comics)|Callisto]]. Parker and [[Betty Brant]] from the [[Daily Bugle]] went to investigate the disappearances. However, Hunger knocked Parker out and took Betty with him. Parker as Spider-Man teamed up with [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]] to hunt down Hunger. They freed the prisoners, much to Hunger's annoyance. As he was about to bite Spider-Man, [[Flash Thompson]] attacked from behind, saving Spider-Man. He then tried to attack Marrow, but Spider-Man freed Marrow, allowing him to escape in energy form.<ref name="Spider-Man Vol 2.4" />

Hunger returned and attacked the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] during a clandestine meeting with the [[Maggia (comics)|Maggia]]. He set the building alight, but the Kingpin was able to escape. He turned a number of them into living vampires, like himself, building his own small army. [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] and Spider-Man tracked Hunger down to an abandoned [[Roxxon]] plant, killing vampire gangsters. He summoned the heroes to his lair to replenish his vampire army. They defeated the last of his horde and Hunger fled.<ref name="Spider-Man Vol 2.7" />

==Powers and abilities==
He was transformed by Morbius into a "Living Vampire" a kind of pseudo-vampire. He does not possess all the powers of a supernatural vampire, nor is he subject to all the traditional limitations and weaknesses thereof. He possesses a variety of superhuman powers, some of which are similar to supernatural vampires within the Marvel Universe, such as superhuman strength and speed, as well as heightened senses including [[night vision]] and [[Animal echolocation|echolocation]].<ref name="Spider-Man Vol 2.7" />

Due to his vampire-like condition, Hunger is forced to ingest fresh blood on a regular basis to sustain his life and vitality.<ref name="Spider-Man Vol 2.4" />

He does not possess any of the mystical vulnerabilities that supernatural vampires are subject to, such as [[garlic]], [[holy water]], [[crucifix]]es, or [[silver]].  He has a strong aversion to sunlight, thanks to his photo-sensitive skin which allows some protection from major sunburn, in contrast to "true" vampires that are incinerated by it, with the result that he can move in daylight, but his powers are diminished and he will stick to the shade if circumstances demand him to be active during the day.<ref name="Spider-Man Vol 2.4" />

==In other media==
===Film===
*Loxias Crown is set to appear as the main antagonist in [[Sony Pictures Motion Picture Group|Sony Pictures]]' film, ''[[Morbius (film)|Morbius]]'', portrayed by [[Matt Smith]].<ref name="Smith" />
