'''Edward Charles Allan''' "'''Eddie'''" '''Brock''' is a [[fictional character]]<!-- Please do not specify what type of character you think they are. Categories like "superhero" & "supervillian" are subjective. It's better to use a generic term and let the reader decide for themselves.--> appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character was created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Todd McFarlane]], making a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #18 (September [[1986 in comics|1986]]),<ref>''Spider-Man Saga'' #4, February 1992</ref> before making his first full appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #300 (May [[1988 in comics|1988]])<ref name="ComicsPriceGuide" /> as the original and most well-known host of the [[Venom (character)|'''Venom''']] [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]]. The character has since appeared in many Marvel Comics publications, including ''[[Venom (comic book)|Venom]]''. He has endured as one of Spider-Man's most prominent villains, and is regarded as one of his three [[Archenemy|archenemies]], alongside the [[Norman Osborn|Green Goblin]] and [[Doctor Octopus]]. He later evolved into an [[antihero]], slowly distancing himself from his initial goal to ruin Spider-Man's life to instead do good.

In the original version of the story, Eddie Brock is a journalist who publicly exposes the identity of a man he believes is a serial killer, the [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]], only to find his reputation ruined when Spider-Man captures the real killer. Disgraced and suicidal with a growing irrational hatred for Spider-Man, Brock comes into contact with an alien symbiote, rejected by Peter Parker. The symbiote bonds with him and they become Venom, together seeking out revenge against their mutual enemy. Though he repeatedly comes into conflict with Spider-Man, he also attempts to operate as a hero, albeit a violent one, seeking to save those he deems "innocent" and avoid any collateral damage in his clashes with Spider-Man. In 2008, after being separated from the Venom symbiote, he serves as the anti-hero host of the '''[[Anti-Venom (symbiote)|Anti-Venom]]''' symbiote which is sacrificed to help cure the "[[Spider-Island]]" epidemic during the 2011 storyline. In 2012, he was bonded to the [[Toxin (comics)|'''Toxin''']] symbiote, reuniting with the Venom symbiote in 2018. Though Brock is a human with no powers, the Venom symbiote suit bestows upon him a range of abilities including many of Spider-Man's powers.

Debuting in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]], the character has featured in various Marvel-endorsed products outside of comics, including [[feature film]]s, [[:Category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]], and [[video games]]; and merchandise such as [[action figure]]s, and [[trading card]]s. [[Topher Grace]] portrays Eddie Brock/Venom in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007), while [[Tom Hardy]] portrays [[Eddie Brock (Sony's Spider-Man Universe)|the character]] in [[Sony's Spider-Man Universe]], starting with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'' (2018) and the sequel ''[[Venom: Let There Be Carnage]]'' (2021). Hardy also appeared as the character in a post-credit in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] film ''[[Spider-Man: No Way Home]]'' (2021).

==Publication history==
{{See also|Venom (comic book)|List of Venom titles}}
===Creation and conception===
Writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Todd McFarlane]] are generally credited with the character's creation, based on a number of plot ideas and concepts from various other creators. The question of who created the character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie wrote to the comic book industry magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'', which had referred to Michelinie in issue #17 as "co-creator" of Venom. In his letter, printed in issue #21 (May 1993), Michelinie wrote that he was the character's sole creator, while acknowledging that without McFarlane the character would not have attained the popularity it did.<ref>''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #21 (May 1993)</ref>

Writer [[Peter David]] corroborated Michelinie's view in his "But I Digress" column in the June 4, 1993 ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', in which he stated that Michelinie discussed the ideas behind the character with him at the time of its creation. At that time, David was the writer on ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' and wrote the "Sin Eater" storyline from which Eddie Brock's backstory would be derived, well before McFarlane was assigned to the art duties on ''Amazing''. Because the artist who illustrates a character's first published appearance is generally credited as its co-creator (especially if that artist is the one who designs the character's visual appearance),<ref>Cronin, Brian (April 2, 2009). [https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-legends-revealed-201/ "Comic Book Legends Revealed #201"]. [[CBR.com]].</ref> Venom represents a complex situation, because the costume from which Venom's appearance is derived was not designed by McFarlane.<ref name=PeterDavid>[[David, Peter]] (June 4, 1993). "[http://www.peterdavid.net/2010/07/05/the-wacko-theory/#more-4742 The Wacko Theory]", ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', Reprinted in the collection ''But I Digress'' (1994). pp. 104–106</ref>

[[Erik Larsen]] responded to Michelinie's letter with one of his own that was printed in ''Wizard'' #23 (July 1993), in which he dismissed Michelinie's contributions to the character, arguing that Michelinie merely "swiped" the preexisting symbiote and its powers to place it on a character whose motivations were poorly conceived, one-dimensional, unbelievable, and clichéd. Larsen also argued that it was McFarlane's rendition of the character that made it commercial.<ref>''Wizard'' magazine #23, July 1993</ref>

The preexisting elements that dealt with the symbiote costume itself—to which Michelinie did not contribute—have also been noted. The original idea of a new costume for Spider-Man that would later become the character Venom was conceived of by a Marvel Comics reader from [[Norridge, Illinois]] named Randy Schueller.<ref>{{Cite web|author=Cronin, Brian|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller's Brush With Comic History &#124 |publisher=CBR.com|date=May 16, 2007}}</ref> Marvel purchased the idea for $220.00 after the editor-in-chief at the time, [[Jim Shooter]], sent Schueller a letter acknowledging Marvel's desire to acquire the idea from him, in 1982. Schueller's design was then modified by [[Mike Zeck]], becoming the Symbiote costume.<ref>[http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/wp-content/uploads/2007/05/Spidey_005.JPG August 3, 1992 letter from Jim Shooter to Randy Schueller]. Comic Book Resources. Retrieved November 21, 2011</ref> For example, Shooter came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman]], with artists [[Mike Zeck]] and [[Rick Leonardi]], as well as others, designing the black-and-white costume.<ref name=PeterDavid/>

Writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] asserts on his website that the idea for a costume made of self-healing biological material was one he originated when he was the artist on ''[[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]]'' to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue, explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that [[Roger Stern]] later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Ron Frenz]] who had established that the costume was a sentient alien being, and that it was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that preceded Michelinie's.<ref>[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]. [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&T1=Miscellaneous+Questions#96 "How is it that JB "created" Venom?"]. "Frequently Asked Questions". Byrne Robotics. Retrieved July 2, 2011.</ref> Regardless, Peter David's position is that Michelinie is the sole creator, since the idea of creating a ''separate'' character using the alien symbiote was Michelinie's, as was Eddie Brock's backstory, and that without the idea to create such a character, the character would not have existed.<ref name=PeterDavid/>

In an interview with Tom DeFalco, McFarlane states that Michelinie did indeed come up with the idea of Venom and the character's basic design ("a big guy in the black costume"). However, he contends that it was he (McFarlane) who gave Venom his monster-like features. He claims; "I just wanted to make him kooky and creepy, and not just some guy in a black suit".<ref>''Comics Creators on Spider-Man'', pg 148, Tom DeFalco. (Titan Books, 2004)</ref>

This dispute arose at a time when the merits of artists as collaborators and writers were being debated in the industry, a discussion prompted by the popularity of artists such as McFarlane, Larsen, and other founders of [[Image Comics]].<ref>Wallace, Dave (February 10, 2007).

Venom's existence was first indicated in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #18 (Sept. 1986), when he shoves [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in front of a subway train without Parker's spider-sense warning him, though only Brock's hand is seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #24 (March 1987), when Parker has climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but finds a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense.

The character would remain unseen and inactive until ''Amazing Spider-Man'' editor [[Jim Salicrup]] required a villain for that book's 300th issue, and Michelinie suggested a villain consisting of the alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] grafted onto the body of a human female; seeking revenge for the deaths of her husband and miscarried baby who would accidentally die as the unfortunate result of Spider-Man battling another supervillain. Due to cultural sensibilities at the time and issues with the character's back story potentially angering the [[moral majority]], Salicrup forced Michelinie to create a male character instead. Michelinie then devised the Eddie Brock identity. Michelinie contends that the plots for issues #298–299, as well as the visual descriptions of the character, were written and bought by Salicrup before McFarlane was ever assigned to the book.<ref name="ComicPop">{{cite web |author=Big Shots |title=David Michelinie |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sBuFsRrLco&t=1252s | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201109053920/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1sBuFsRrLco| archive-date=2020-11-09|via=YouTube |publisher=ComicPop |access-date=5 January 2020}}</ref> In a 2014 interview with the [[YouTube]] channel ComicPop, Michelinie said he was disappointed that the female character arc was never explored, but felt that changing the character to male ultimately had minimal effect on his vision for the character. In the same interview, Michelinie remarked that he was largely happy with the treatment Eddie Brock had received by successive Marvel writers.<ref name="ComicPop" />

The 2003 story "The Hunger" introduced new elements to Brock's origin, revealing that Brock had cancer before joining with the symbiote, and that it chose to bond with Brock not only for his hatred towards Spider-Man, but also because the cancer causes the release of adrenaline, which feeds the symbiote. Brock is left reliant on the suit to live, and pursues Spider-Man out of fear that he will take the symbiote back, rather than for revenge over his lost career.<ref name="Spectacular5"/> Brock dies after the symbiote leaves him for Spider-Man, not wanting a diseased host.

===King in Black===

In the ''Venom'' ongoing series, Eddie is seen struggling with the symbiote, which has returned to its violent ways. Using [[anti-depressants]], Eddie is able to calm the symbiote and reassert control over it. While working as a freelance photographer he stumbles upon an arms deal between a gang of criminals and the mercenary [[Jack O'Lantern (Marvel Comics)|Jack O'Lantern]]. The deal turns violent and Eddie uses the symbiote to take down Jack. The symbiote then completely overtakes Eddie, compelled by a mysterious external influence, nearly killing Jack in the process before being subdued and captured by a man named Rex Strickland. Strickland tells Eddie that despite what was previously thought, the Venom symbiote was not the first to arrive on Earth. Strickland explains that the US Government bonded special forces operatives to symbiotes during the [[Vietnam War]]. These soldiers later went rogue, and Eddie is tasked with rescuing them and defeating their symbiotes. Though Eddie is able to locate Strickland's men, his symbiote is again taken over by the mysterious outside influence and briefly separates from him. The symbiote again bonds with Eddie and tells him that “God is coming”.<ref>''Venom'' #1-2</ref>

Soon afterward, a massive dragon made up of thousands of symbiotes attacks [[New York City]]. Eddie resolves to stop the monster before it destroys the city. Before he can intervene he is attacked by [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Miles Morales]], who uses his “Venom Blast” ability to break Venom out of the symbiote “god's” influence. Miles and Eddie form a temporary truce, and the two manage to temporarily stop the symbiote god's rampage. The symbiote god then reveals itself as a being named [[Knull (comics)|Knull]]. Knull separates Eddie from his symbiote, promising to purge the influence of humanity from it.<ref>''Venom'' #3</ref> But then Miles attacked Knull and both Eddie with Venom and Miles started falling until Venom grew a pair of wings and saved Eddie and Miles. After leaving Miles behind, Eddie went to Rex and put a hole in his head revealing that Rex was actually the symbiote that was bonded to the original Rex Strickland. After that, they tricked the dragon to come to them and started attacking it with sonic-based weapons which weaken it. Then Eddie puts the dragon with Rex in the furnace and incinerated it to death, while Eddie and Venom got wounded in the process.<ref>''Venom'' #5</ref>

Eddie Brock after getting recovered, he's interrogated by the [[Maker (Reed Richards)|Maker]] about the incident revolving around the Grendel symbiote and Knull while stating that he is not the Mister Fantastic that he is familiar with. In addition, he also talked about how the Venom symbiote was in a feral state and has been deleting Eddie's bad memories like when he found out that his father had remarried and has a child named Dylan. When Maker throws a scalpel at Eddie Brock, the Venom symbiote emerges from his shirt and catches it. Though the Venom symbiote is currently brain dread. When Eddie asks Maker if he would be able to restore it, Maker states that the only way to do that is to connect it to the Symbiote hive mind and the last person to do that was the late [[Flash Thompson]]. As Maker comments that he has ways of extracting the information he needs, Eddie asks in a distraught voice if Flash is really dead.<ref>''Venom'' vol. 4 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref>
Sometime after, Maker reveals to Eddie that he got hold of Venom's remnants left in Flash's body prior to becoming Anti-Venom, which contained his genetic memory, and tells Eddie that it can help restore the symbiote. Maker also tells to Eddie that he's planning to get more samples from Flash's dead body, but Eddie who now considers Flash as a brother unleashes the symbiote to Maker and gets the sample. Afterward, he tries to escape the facility, but the sample goes to his symbiote taking the form of Flash's version of the suit. Now the symbiote with the mind of Flash Thompson helps Eddie to escape and then Eddie goes to Flash's grave to admit that Flash was a better host than him.<ref>''Venom #8''. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After a failed attempt to win his father's affection, he gets to know Dylan, until he got seriously sick. Then Dylan takes Eddie to a hospital, where Maker found him again. After a confrontation with the symbiote, he recovers the memories that the symbiote had erased finds out that Dylan is actually his own son with Anne Weying.<ref>''Venom'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref> During [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]]'s invasion on Earth, Eddie temporarily uses the Dark Elf Witch's totem to transform into a Venom-look alike, and immediately resist being the Accursed elf's servant at will.<ref>''Venom'' #13-16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After being framed by a resurrected Knullified Cletus Kasady for the murder of Lee Price, Eddie and Dylan are on the run and rescued by Venom, while seeking help from many available superheroes in New York, such as Peter, Miles, the X-Men, the Fantastic Four, and the Avengers, including the villains Mac Gargan and Maker, in order for Dylan, as well as [[Normie Osborn]] to be tested if they have symbiote codex within them.<ref>''Absolute Carnage'' (2019). Marvel Comics.</ref> Upon learning his son is Knull's current vessel and would be his host, Eddie and Dylan were originally with Maker but was interrupted by a mysterious bounty hunter in a painted War Machine Mark III suit named "Virus" (who is actually Mac Gargan), and both Eddie and Dylan end up in a universe overrun by Knullified heroes and villains led by Codex (the fallen alternate universe's Dylan). He and Dylan are rescued by Agent Symbiotes (such as the alternate Anne Weying, Spider-Man, Deadpool, and a reformed Cletus Kasady/Carnage) and Mr. Fantastic. Dylan eventually learns that not only he is Eddie's son, but also Anne's. With temporary help from the prime universe's Mac Gargan, Dylan manages to purify his older counterpart and free the Earth. One year later after spending time with alternate Anne, at a time when Eddie and Dylan return to prime Earth, they happened to learn Knull has been re-awakened and begin a full-scale invasion on Earth.<ref>''Venom'' Vol. 4 #28-30.

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)#Powers and abilities}}
Brock is a human and has no superhuman powers without the Symbiote. Prior to joining with the Symbiote, he possesses olympic-level strength from engaging in repeated, significant weight-training exercise.<ref name="Amazing300"/><ref name="LethalProtector4"/>

After separating from the Symbiote and suffering from cancer, Brock loses much of his physical muscle and possesses the strength of an average human.<ref name="AvengersAnnual1"/><ref name="SensationalV238"/> Brock's cancer is cured in the 2008 story "New Ways to Die", and he is later shown with a restored large physique.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> He is also shown to be proficient in hand to hand combat and capable of using specialized weaponry to defeat symbiote-empowered enemies.<ref>''Venom'' #15 and #17. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In an interview, David Michelinie stated that the reason Brock was written to be at the peak of human physical condition in the Marvel Universe was because editor [[Jim Salicrup]] felt that having an average human with no super powers becoming stronger than Spider-Man by simply bonding with the Symbiote did not seem believable. Michelinie later clarified in the interview that a healthy Eddie Brock is stronger without super powers than Peter Parker is without his super powers, which explains how the Symbiote is able to make him stronger than Spider-Man.<ref name="ComicPop" /> Michelinie later toyed with this concept in early Venom stories in [[The Amazing Spider-Man]] such as ''Venom vs. Spider-Man Round 2'' and ''Venom Returns''.{{citation needed|date=January 2020}} In both of these stories Eddie is seen lifting weights and training himself without the help of the symbiote, remarking that making himself inherently stronger and more fit will enable the symbiote to grant him even greater super strength, speed, and agility.{{issue|date=January 2020}}

Once Eddie became the new King in Black, he attended almost god-like abilities through the symbiotes Hive Mind. It granted him near omnipresent powers through the eyes of billions of symbiotes and is also capable of remote-piloting the symbiotes, though with consent unlike Knull, no matter how far away they in the universe. He also discover that he can access through the memories of the symbiotes (including his own memories), some that which are from history or even beyond dimensions; Eddie even believe that with time and patience, he may be able to travel through and even change certain events. The only consequence to obtaining this new status is that due to being a human, his body is already rapidly aging due to connecting to the hive for the past few months.

===As Venom===
As Venom, Brock gains several abilities similar to those of Spider-Man, the Symbiote's former host, including superhuman strength, speed, agility and reflexes as well as the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet. The Symbiote is also able to project a web-like substance from its body, similar to Spider-Man's. However, this webbing is produced organically by the Symbiote from its own mass, which means that overuse can weaken the alien until it is able to regenerate.<ref name="Amazing300"/>  The Symbiote can also send out tendrils which can be used to grab or manipulate items from a distance.<ref name="Amazing333"/> When bonded with the host, the Symbiote allows the host to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense, preventing the hero from sensing attacks. The Symbiote is susceptible to harm from high-pitched sonic frequencies which can cause it to be severely weakened or killed. The bond between the Symbiote and Brock was strong enough that using sonics against the Symbiote could also stun and kill Brock.<ref name="Amazing300"/>

Venom's body is highly resistant to injury, capable of outright stopping bladed weapons,<ref name="AmazingAnnual25"/> bullets,<ref name="Amazing333"/> and it can help its host survive in hostile environments by filtering air, allowing survival underwater<ref name="Amazing347"/> and in toxic environments. Venom can also morph his appearance, to create disguises at will,<ref name="Amazing300"/><ref name="Amazing333"/> and camouflage itself,<ref name="LethalProtector3"/> even emulating water.<ref name="Amazing347"/>  It is also capable of psychically detecting its offspring; however, this ability can be blocked.<ref name="Amazing362"/>  This sense can be used by Brock even when separated from the suit, allowing him to detect and be detected by the Symbiote and its children.<ref name="Separation2"/><ref name="Separation3"/>  The Symbiote is capable of healing any injury and illness at an increased rate, allowing the host to survive otherwise-mortal damage.<ref name="Sinner2"/> The Symbiote and host are capable of sharing knowledge, the Symbiote being able to pass on information from previous hosts to future ones.<ref name="SensationalV27"/>

===As Anti-Venom===
Anti-Venom is created when the healing energies of Martin Li cause Brock's white-blood cells and traces of the Venom Symbiote still within his body to combine into a new suit composed of human/alien hybrid antibodies possessing powerful restorative abilities.<ref name="Amazing568"/><ref name="Amazing572"/>  Brock is capable of rapidly healing significant injury as Anti-Venom, recovering almost instantly after being shot in the head and suffering damage to his brain.<ref name="Amazing664"/><ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/>  However, this healing ability can be negated by the energy of Mr. Negative, counteracting the energy of Martin Li.<ref name="Amazing664"/>  Anti-Venom is able to detect when others are ill<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> and "cure" or "cleanse" them. He is able to cure ailments from hepatitis to removing narcotics and even radiation from a person's body.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>  Following a failed attempt to "cure" Spider-Man by removing the radiation in his body, Anti-Venom now automatically cancels out Spider-Man's powers whenever the two are in close proximity to one another.<ref name="Amazing663"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>

As Anti-Venom, Brock's suit is corrosive to the Venom symbiote, inflicting pain and damage on the suit to the point of causing it to dissolve.<ref name="Amazing569"/><ref name="Amazing570"/> He displays similar abilities to Venom, possessing super strength, speed,<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/> negating Spider-Man's spider-sense,<ref name="Amazing570"/> and being able to block damage entirely from some guns and knives.<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/><ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/>  He is also capable of extending and morphing the suit to create disguises,<ref name="Amazing571"/> form items such as shields,<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/> extend his reach,<ref name="Amazing663"/> attack from a distance,<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3"/> and create tendrils.<ref name="NewWaysToLive1"/>  Anti-Venom is also immune to the weaknesses of the Venom Symbiote, showing no damage or effect from direct blasts of fire, heat and sound.<ref name="AntiVenomNewWaystoLive"/><ref name="Amazing571"/>  The only shown weaknesses of the Symbiote are a highly toxic "super venom" created as a direct countermeasure using remnants of Anti-Venom's suit, and Mr. Negative's energy.<ref name="Amazing572"/>  The "super venom" causes the suit to immediately dissolve.<ref name="Amazing573"/> Mr. Negative is shown capable of using his energy to weaken or nullify the healing abilities of the suit.<ref name="Amazing664"/>
