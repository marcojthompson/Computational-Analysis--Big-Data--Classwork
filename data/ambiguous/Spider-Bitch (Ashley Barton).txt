'''Spider-Bitch''' ('''Ashley Barton'''; [[colloquial]]: '''"Spider-Woman"''' or '''"Spider-Girl"''') is a fictional character appearing in [[American comic book|comic books]] published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by [[Mark Millar]] and [[Steve McNiven]], she is the estranged daughter of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]'s youngest daughter [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|Tonya]] and [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]], and the stepdaughter of Tonya's husband [[Ultron#Old Man Logan|Ultron-8]], from the [[Parallel universes in fiction|alternate-future]] of [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#List of main alternate Earths and universes|Earth-807128]], in which the supervillains overthrew the [[superhero]]es three decades earlier. After being saved from execution by her estranged father and [[Old Man Logan]], Spider-Bitch kills the current [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin of Crime]], succeeding him as the '''Kingpin of the Wastelands''', before unsuccessfully attempting to kill her father and Logan.

Spider-Bitch is subsequently among the first recruited to a [[resistance movement]] against [[Inheritors (comics)|the Inheritors]]' consumption of [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|Spider-People]] across the [[Spider-Verse]] by [[the Superior Spider-Man]], [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius]], in order to devise a plan to kill them all; in the aftermath of the conflict, Spider-Bitch continues to explore the [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]], assisting various teams of Spider-People while funnelling resources back to her home dimension.

Due to the child-oriented storylines of the character's initial appearances post-''Old Man Logan'', she is alternately referred to as "Spider-Woman" or "Spider-Girl" due to [[Censorship in the United States|censorship]] in text box descriptions, referring to herself as "the Spider-B****" in dialogue. Despite her get-up, Spider-Bitch did not inherit her grandfather's powers or abilities, only acquiring a cold and calculating personality and corrupted moral code from being raised in the Wastelands, aiding her rise to power, which is mellowed out in the company of other Spider-People, and a peak human strength from training.

Spider-Bitch was met with positive reviews from critics, with them lauding her name, design, and character, compared to [[Boba Fett#The Book of Boba Fett|Boba Fett]]—and a [[feminism|feminist]] perspective. For promotion, several other versions of the character were developed, accompanied by merchandise. She was also featured in the [[radio drama]] [[podcast]] series ''[[Marvel's Wastelanders]]'' as '''Ash Morse / King Zemo''', voiced by [[Sasha Lane]], and in multiple video games as a playable character.

==Fictional character biography==
===''Old Man Logan''===
In the future of ''[[Old Man Logan]]'', thirty years after the supervillains overthrew the superheroes, the [[Old Man Logan|title character]] and the now-blind [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)|Clint Barton / Hawkeye]] are passing through Hammer Falls, [[Nevada]] after Clint hired Logan as protection while delivering a shipment cross-country, when the pair are greeted by [[Ultron#Old Man Logan|Ultron Eight]], the current husband of Clint's third ex-wife Tonya (the youngest daughter of [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]) and stepfather to their 22-year-old daughter '''Ashley''', both of whom Clint had left when she was three months old with limited contact since. Assuming Clint is there because of a letter Tonya had sent him, Ultron is surprised to learn that he hasn't received it and directs him to Tonya, who informs Clint that Ashley and her friends, apparently inspired by stories of Clint and her grandfather, had formed a super-team and gone north to [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]] to take down the current [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin of Crime]] (the [[Michael Clarke Duncan]] incarnation from [[Daredevil (film)|''Daredevil'']]), before being captured and set to be [[Public execution|publicly executed]] the following morning; Ashley is shown to be in a prison cell to be dressed in a costume similar to that of the deceased [[Spider-Woman|Spider-Women]] and her aunt [[Spider-Girl (Mayday Parker)|Mayday Parker / Spider-Girl]].<ref>[[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' Vol. 3]] #67 (September [[2008 in comics|2008]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Surprised, having "never really had Ashley pegged as the superhero type", telling Tonya that he had gotten the impression that she was an "evil badass type [who] never really seemed especially altruistic" from the few encounters he had had with her, Clint nonetheless agrees to rescue her and doubles Logan's salary to convince him to help him rescue her. While en route, passing through [[Cedar City]], Clint tells Logan that while surprised, he is "so friggin' ''proud''" of his daughter; meanwhile, in the [[Rice–Eccles Stadium]] in Salt Lake City (now Fisk Lake City), the Kingpin feeds the other members of Ashley's team, successors to [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] and [[Punisher|the Punisher]], to ''[[utahraptor]]s'' while bragging over having killed [[Magneto]] during his rise to power, as the pair beg to know what they had done to Ashley. Elsewhere, in her cell inside a customized [[Walmart]]-turned-prison, Ashley, known as "Spider-Bitch", sits silently as some of her guards mock the concept of superheroes, before Clint and Logan crash their [[Spider-Mobile]] through the wall of the prison. Stating "That'll be Dad." upon hearing the crash, Ashley watches as her father massacre the guards before telling him precisely where on the wall the [[control panel (engineering)|control panel]] for her cell is so he can open it, shooting it with an arrow. As the Kingpin enters the room to see what the commotion is, the newly freed Ashley immediately decapitates him by swinging the end of a shotgun into his neck, before knocking a surprised Clint to the ground: Ashley explains that she came to the area not as a superhero, but a [[supervillain]], intending to seize control of the Kingpin's Quarter (formerly [[Las Vegas]]) by killing him, the same way him himself had taken over by killing [[Magneto]]. As she prepares to beat her father to death,<ref>[[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' Vol. 3]] #68 (October [[2008 in comics|2008]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> Ashley tells him that she's "doing it because I want to", before Logan, having witnessed Ashley's actions, crashes through the skylight in the Spider-Mobile and rescues Clint. Overlooking the escaping duo, Ashley orders a segment of her new army to go after them, taking her rightful place as '''Spider-Bitch, the Kingpin of the Wastelands'''.<ref>[[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' Vol. 3]] #69 (November [[2008 in comics|2008]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> While drinking at a bar with the following day, Clint regrets not being involved in his daughter's life, recalling the day she was born and how she was the first thing she ever saw;<ref>[[Wolverine (comic book)#Volume 3|''Wolverine'' Vol. 3]] #70 (December [[2008 in comics|2008]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> these events are also witnessed by a time-displaced [[Tempus (Eva Bell)|Eva Bell]].<ref>[[All-New X-Men|''All-New X-Men'' Annual Vol. 1]] #1 (December [[2014 in comics|2014]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref>

===''Edge of Spider-Verse'' and ''Spider-Verse''===

After sending the rest of the Spider-Army to research Karn and his siblings, Otto takes Spider-Bitch and Black-Ops Spider-Man aside to discuss their shared perspective as "killers" who have seen "Brutality. Devastation. Darkness." and whether they are willing to "the face of true evil" and potentially commit [[genocide]] against the Inheritors. After a pause, the trio agree, with Spider-Bitch, acknowledging Otto as "[[Supervisor|boss]]", stating that "If we're going to survive this, we'll do whatever we have to.

In the [[prequel]] series [[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)#Old Man Logan|''Old Man Hawkeye'']] (Jan.–Dec.

Hearing from Tonya that Ashley had recently gotten in trouble for fighting, Clint is initially proud to hear that she had beaten up a bully who had in turn been "beating up one of the fat kids" and stealing his money, only to learn that she had beaten them both up due the "fat kid" having been paying her for protection, and she was insulted by the "disrespect" he had showed by keeping money from her. Dismissing her father's attempts at small talk, Ashley asks Clint why he is really there. After she is dismissive of his vague response, Clint leaves Ashley be, leaving to fulfil his [[Feud|vendetta]] with the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] before he is fully blind.<ref>[[Hawkeye (Clint Barton)#Old Man Logan|''Old Man Hawkeye'']] #1 (January [[2018 in comics|2018]]) [[Marvel Comics]].</ref> A few days later, [[Bullseye (character)#Old Man Logan|Marshal Bullseye]], tracking Clint's subsequent killings, visits Hammer Falls and questions Ashley about Clint (whom he rightfully suspects to be behind the killings) outside her mother's garage.

Running for [[student government president]] in her high school on a platform of criticising the Kingdom of [[Helmut Zemo|Zemo]] in which she lives, Ash is horrified when her best friend Max suffers a drug overdose of "Hype" (a [[drug]] granting superpowers to the consumer), which he had been ingesting in order to serve as her [[bodyguard]], and is apparently explodes, killing himself alongside several other students. Swearing revenge, Ash learns the source of the drugs to be the Brotherhood Traveling Circus, Carnival and Ringmaster's Road Show, to which Clint is employed, and recruits him to find the distributor of the drugs to kill them, briefly reuniting with her birth mother Kate during the process. After learning Max's supplier to have been [[Blob (comics)|Frederick Dukes, Junior]]., Ash attempts to kill him before learning he had been manipulated by a [[Ringmaster (comics)#Podcast|Maynard "Ringmaster" Tiboldt]], and that Max is actually still alive and safe, hidden by him in the woods neighbouring the circus, having teleported away after causing the explosion. Reunited with Max, Ash begins to question her desire for revenge and the path it will bring her down in life.<ref>{{cite news|title={{'}}''Marvel's Wastelanders: Hawkeye''{{'}} Scripted Podcast to Premiere October 4|date=September 21, 2021|work=Laughing Place|url=https://www.laughingplace.com/w/news/2021/09/21/marvels-wastelanders-hawkeye-premiere-october-4/|access-date=September 21, 2021}}</ref><ref>{{Cite magazine|last=Levitt|first=Hayley|date=October 15, 2021|title=A Marvel Podcast Is Rachel Chavkin's Latest Larger-Than-Life Stage|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/a-marvel-podcast-is-rachel-chavkins-latest-larger-than-life-stage|magazine=Playbill |language=en|access-date=November 9, 2021}}</ref>
** Sometime later, Ash discovers that the current "King Zemo" is actually Zemo's teenage son Herman, who has been impersonating his father [[Helmut Zemo|Helmut]] since his death ten years earlier using his mask and voice box. Upon being discovered, having been seeking an "out" from being king, Herman flees with his fortune while leaving Ash his mask and voice box, which she uses to become the new '''King Zemo''' and one of the seven [[dictator]]s of the Wastelands.
