==Powers and abilities==
Kenuichio Harada is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the ability to generate a [[tachyon]] field, with which he can surround anything{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}. He commonly uses his power on his sword, enabling it to cut through nearly anything, except substances as hard as [[adamantium]]. When working with the [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Viper]], Kenuichio possessed a [[teleportation]] ring, which allowed him to teleport from one location to another, granting him great mobility and stealth. As a self-styled samurai, he is a master of [[kenjutsu]] and other martial arts. Kenuichio specialized in edged weapons, hand-to-hand combat, and [[military tactics]]. He usually wears a suit of lightweight steel alloy body armor, modeled after traditional samurai armor, but made of modern protective materials. He carries a katana (long sword), shuriken (throwing stars), and other weaponry. Keniuchio has extensive knowledge of the operations of criminal organizations due to his shady past, which he used in the service of his government to combat such organizations. He is an expert in the history and customs of the samurai class ([[Bushido]]).
