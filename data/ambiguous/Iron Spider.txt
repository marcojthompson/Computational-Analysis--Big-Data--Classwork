The '''Iron Spider''' is a fictional [[powered exoskeleton]] used by several characters in [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
The Iron Spider armor first appeared in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #529 and was designed by [[Joe Quesada]], based on a sketch by [[Chris Bachalo]].<ref name="marvelironspider">[http://www.marvel.com/publishing/stories/showstory.htm?id=67 Marvel.com announcement of Spider-Man's "Iron Spider" costume] {{webarchive|url=http://wayback.vefsafn.is/wayback/20060306145039/http%3A//www.marvel.com/publishing/stories/showstory.htm?id%3D67 |date=March 6, 2006 }}</ref><ref>Goldstein, Hilary (January 11, 2006). [http://www.ign.com/articles/2006/01/12/spideys-new-costume-revealed "Spidey's New Costume Revealed"]. [[IGN]].</ref>

Peter Parker wore this gold and red suit as Spider-Man's official costume until writer [[J. Michael Straczynski]] chose to revert to the older costume. It was used symbolically to show the character's divided loyalties during the 2006 - 2007 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" storyline.

==Known wearers==
===Peter Parker===

{{expand section|date=July 2016}}

===Scarlet Spiders===
The Iron Spider armor costume has been duplicated and used by [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP's]] three genetic clones in the [[Avengers: The Initiative|Initiative]] who identify themselves as Red Team and also labeled the [[Scarlet Spider]]s. It is unknown as to what new powers the team possesses, but they have been shown to use some of the built-in powers such as the cloaking device, communications, and [[waldoes]] which the original costume possessed.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #3</ref> One change is that there are now four waldoes, as opposed to three. These suits have the original's morphing ability,<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> as well as web-shooters, and wall-crawling capability.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative Annual'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Mary Jane Watson===
{{main|Mary Jane Watson}}
Mary Jane Watson later donned the Iron Spider armor in order to help Spider-Man and Iron Man fight [[Regent (comics)|Regent]]. She uses her experience in Iron Man's suit and her brief spider powers that she had back in the ''[[Spider-Island]]'' storyline to operate the armor.<ref>''Amazing Spider-Man'' Vol. 4 #15</ref>

===Amadeus Cho===

==Powers and abilities==
Supported by a system similar to that of Tony Stark's classic [[Iron Man]] design, The Iron Spider armor features many gadgets, including three mechanical spider-arms, or "[[Remote manipulator|waldoes]]", that can be used to see around corners (via cameras in the tips) and to manipulate objects indirectly. Stark describes them as too delicate to use in combat, yet Spider-Man shortly afterward uses them to smash through the sensors in [[Titanium Man]]'s helmet. Later on during the "Civil War" arc, he uses them (reluctantly) during his fight with [[Captain America]].

Other features include short-distance gliding capability, limited bulletproofing, built-in [[fire department|fire]]/[[police]]/emergency scanner, audio/visual amplification (including [[infrared]] and [[ultraviolet]]), [[stealth technology|cloaking]] device, carbon filters to keep out airborne [[toxin]]s, and a short-range [[GPS]] microwave communication system. It grants the ability to breathe under water, and can morph into different shapes due to its "'smart' liquid metal" form. It can also "more or less disappear" when not needed due to reactions to neurological impulses as Tony Stark revealed. The new costume is able to look like other styles of costumes Spider-Man has worn over the years or turn into his street clothes. Part of the costume can detach itself from Spider-Man to cover an object too dangerous to touch, such as a radioactive asteroid. All these features are controlled by a computer system in the chest piece. The suit responds to mental control.<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #530. Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Iron Spider armor also has a secret override that can be activated by Iron Man in case of emergencies or if Spider-Man ever switches sides.  However, unknown to Stark, Peter was already aware of the safety measure and had bypassed it with his own override, Passcode Surprise. Perhaps most sinister, Stark discovered a way to give his own Iron Man armor a "spider-sense" based on Peter's, and the ability to give Spider-Man's sense [[Red herring (plot device)|red herrings]].<ref>''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #536. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
In the pages of ''Contest of Champions'', a variation of [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Natasha Romanov]] donned the Iron Spider identity in an unidentified alternate reality where Iron Man used the Reality Gem to rig the ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' in his favor where he later became President of the United States. She inherited it after Peter defected to Captain America's side and later became a member of the Civil Warriors.<ref>''Contest of Champions'' (2015) #9-10. Marvel Comics.</ref>

* The armor returns in ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) when Parker and the Blip's other victims are resurrected and joins the Avengers' battle against an alternate timeline version of Thanos.
* The armor briefly returns in the opening of ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' (2019), though Parker leaves it at home in favor of focusing on his social life and going on a school trip.
