He previously went by the codename '''Goldballs''', but has changed to '''Egg''' following changes in the X-Men during the "[[Dawn of X]]" relaunch. The character is depicted usually as a member of the [[X-Men]] or as a supporting character in stories featuring the [[Miles Morales]] version of [[Spider-Man]].

==Fictional character biography==
Fabio Medina is a teenaged [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] whose powers first appear when he was the victim of an attempted robbery on the streets of San Diego. After manifesting his abilities, the [[bouncing ball]]s emanating from his body frighten onlookers, and he is taken into custody by the San Diego Police Department. However, [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] and his group of [[X-Men]] arrive just in time to rescue him. A squad of different-sized [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]] attack the new mutant and Cyclops's team, who managed to destroy the Sentinels. Fabio is then invited to join the X-Men when they departed San Diego. Although Fabio is reluctant, he decides to follow them. Fabio then joins the X-Men during their visit to Eva Bell's home and the encounter with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], before being dragged into limbo during [[Dormammu]]'s attempt to kill them. In the aftermath, Fabio demands to be taken home, where his family questions his disappearance and is befuddled at his claims of being a mutant.{{issue|date=August 2020}}

When [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Dazzler (Marvel Comics)|Alison Blaire (Dazzler)]] arrives and questions him about Cyclops's location, Fabio loses control of his powers. He is taken into S.H.I.E.L.D. custody but is again rescued by Cyclops' team and rejoins them. He later assists in the battle against the Blockbuster Sentinel by concentrating the emission of his gold balls to topple them. He then assumes the mutant nickname "Goldballs".{{issue|date=August 2020}}

After many adventures under the guidance of [[Magik (Illyana Rasputin)|Illyana Rasputin]] and [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]], Goldballs and his teammates express uncertainty about continuing as students anymore.<ref>''Uncanny X-Men'' #18 (October 2014). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Goldballs next appears in ''Spider-Man'', where he is seen attending Brooklyn Visions Academy, where he becomes the classmate of Ganke Lee and  [[Miles Morales]], aka the second Spider-Man.<ref>[[Bendis, Brian Michael]] (w), [[Pichelli, Sara]] (a).

During the "[[House of X and Powers of X]]" storyline, Fabio would make his home on the new mutant homeland of [[Krakoa]] where the true nature of his seemingly mundane mutant powers would be revealed. Working in conjunction with  [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]],  [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]],  [[Tempus (comics)|Tempus]] and  [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]], he uses them to resurrect Cyclops, [[Jean Grey]], [[M (Marvel Comics)|M]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], [[Warren Worthington III]], [[Husk (comics)|Husk]], [[Mystique (comics)|Mystique]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] under [[Professor X|X]]'s instruction.<ref name="House of X #5">''House of X'' #5 (Sep. 2019).

==Powers and abilities==

Goldballs is a [[mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] with the superhuman ability to project at high-speed gold-colored non-viable ball-shaped eggs made of an unknown substance and of different sizes from any part of his body, which can be used as a concussive weapon. Goldballs can summon an infinite number of them, which are able to bounce, emitting a "poink" sound when they hit something. If he concentrates, he can project them in a straight line or direct them to a specific area. Normally the balls can be reabsorbed into his body, though when Goldballs is calm, he can cause them to disappear.<ref>{{cite web|author=Bendis, Brian Michael|url=http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Uncanny_X-Men_Vol_3_1|title=The Uncanny X-Men Vol.3 #1: The New Revolution|date=February 13, 2013|publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> It is later revealed that his abilities, while relatively unimpressive, have the capacity for vast genetic application. The golden spheres made from his own biological matter are a kind of nonviable unfertilized egg. Working as a unit with the mutants [[Proteus (Marvel Comics)|Proteus]] (who makes the eggs viable), [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] (who brings the eggs with introduced DNA to life), [[Tempus (comics)|Eva Bell]] (who speeds the incubation process), and [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope Summers]] (who links and enhances their abilities), Egg becomes a crucial part of rebirthing deceased mutants using their preserved DNA.<ref name="House of X #5"/>
