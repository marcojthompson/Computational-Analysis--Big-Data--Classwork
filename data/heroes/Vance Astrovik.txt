'''Vance Astrovik''', also known as '''Justice<ref>''The New Warriors'' #43</ref>''' and formerly known as '''Marvel Boy''', is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He possesses the [[superhuman]] power of telekinesis. Astrovik has been affiliated with the [[New Warriors]] and [[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]. He first appeared in ''[[The Defenders (comic book)|Giant-Size Defenders]]'' #5 (July 1975) and was created by [[Don Heck]] and [[Gerry Conway]]

==Publication history==
{{expand section|date=March 2015}}
More than a decade after his creation, Vance appeared first as a mainstay in the New Warriors and later in the third volume of the ''Avengers'' titles. He usually appeared with [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], who was his girlfriend then later [[fiancee]].

In 1994, he had his own four issue limited series, ''Justice: Four Balance'' and appeared in the ''I (heart) Marvel: Masked Intentions'' one-shot in 2006.

He was a major character in ''[[Avengers: The Initiative]]'', early in the series.

Justice appeared as a supporting character in ''[[Avengers Academy]]'' from issue #1 (Aug. 2010) through issue #20 (Dec. 2011).

==Fictional character biography==
Vance Astrovik was born in [[Saugerties (town), New York|Saugerties]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. He was visited as a teenager by an alternate, time traveling version of his future self, Major [[Vance Astro]] of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], an [[astronaut]] who had volunteered for an experimental space flight and consequently been lost in space in cryogenic suspension for a thousand years. The elder Vance Astro convinced his younger self to not become an astronaut, and in the process, sparked the premature emergence of the younger Vance's telekinetic powers.<ref>''Marvel Two-In-One'' #69. Marvel Comics.</ref> Due to the vagaries of time travel in the [[Marvel Universe]], this did not create a paradox, but instead made the Guardians' future world into a parallel timeline, to which they later returned. Although Major Vance Astro had not had a chance to fully develop his psionic power in his time in [[NASA]], the younger Astrovik now had the opportunity to hone his power. Astrovik soon became the costumed crime-fighter '''Marvel Boy'''.

===Early adventures===
After his powers developed, Vance's father, Arnold, began to physically abuse him for being "different". Running away from home, Vance wound up supporting himself as a [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] in the Unlimited Class Wrestling Federation, a circuit for superhuman competitors. While wrestling as "Manglin' John Mahoney", he befriended Ben Grimm, a.k.a. the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who at the time was himself estranged from his "family", the [[Fantastic Four]].<ref>''The Thing'' #23. Marvel Comics.</ref> Eventually, Vance was convinced to return home, with assurances from his parents that the abuse would stop.<ref>''The Thing'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===New Warriors===
When Marvel Boy was rejected for membership in the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] by [[Captain America]], he helped found a team of teenage superheroes, the [[New Warriors]], led by the new hero [[Night Thrasher]].<ref>''The New Warriors'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> He had many intense times during this early period, such as a fight against the [[Emma Frost|White Queen]], her [[Hellions (Marvel Comics)|Hellions]]<ref>''The New Warriors'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> and the immortal villain [[Gideon (comics)|Gideon]].<ref>''The New Warriors'' #19. Marvel Comics.</ref> At the same time, Vance developed friendships with the other Warriors, and a romantic relationship with teammate [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]],<ref>''The New Warriors'' #14. Marvel Comics.</ref> and his powers increased both in strength and skill. However, his costumed activities renewed Arnold Astrovik's prejudice towards Vance's powers; both Vance and his mother suffered from Arnold's abusive behavior, and Vance's instinctively protecting himself with his powers only made things worse, with tragic consequences.<ref name=autogenerated1>''The New Warriors'' #20-25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Murder trial===
One night, Arnold Astrovik not only attacked a disadvantaged Vance (injured in a fight with [[Terrax]] and further injured by Gideon), but struck his wife when she tried to intervene. In one burst of his ever-growing superpowers and pent-up emotion, Vance lashed out at his abusive father and unintentionally killed him. Vance turned himself in and went to trial, charged with first degree murder and negligent homicide. He was defended by attorney [[Foggy Nelson]]. The Thing was a [[character witness]] for Vance and helped establish the history of abuse that he suffered, as did Vance's mother, Norma; other testimony established the good he had done as a costumed hero and his increasing competence with his powers. However, the prosecuting attorney pursued the latter angle, using testimony from Firestar and cross-examination of Norma Astrovik to establish that Vance could have used his powers to stop his father without lethal force. Finally, in her closing argument, the prosecutor drew a gun on Vance and fired a (unknown to Vance) blank round. Instinctively, Vance not only disarmed her, but reacted so precisely that he contained the actual smoke from the gun, driving home the prosecution's case. Vance was acquitted of murder, but he was convicted of negligent homicide. As a result of the trial, Vance's secret identity became public knowledge.<ref name=autogenerated1 />

Vance was sentenced to serve his time at the superhuman restraint facility known as the [[Vault (Marvel Comics)|Vault]]. He was shown enjoying the occasional free walkabout on the long road-trip to the Vault, joking and playing around with the officers. When his friends Firestar, Namorita, and Nova arrived to free him, Vance protested, declaring he would serve his time. He also said he was going to be paroled in fourteen months, so they would see him again then. Firestar, even though trying to remain restrained, was very upset, but she recognized what Vance wanted to do and came to terms with it.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #26. Marvel Comics.</ref> 

During his stay in the Vault, he was granted "training periods" with the [[Guardsman (comics)|Guardsmen]] on duty, determined to hone his abilities to prevent another incident like his father's death. When a riot broke out over the perception of poor living conditions, Vance helped calm the riot by convincing the warden to allow the plant-based villain Terraformer (once part of the [[Force of Nature (comics)|Force of Nature]]) access to a plant. Despite the warden's fears that Terraformer would use it in an escape attempt, the villain simply enjoyed it being with him. This calmed the other prisoners and it is agreed that, on a case-by-case basis, their living conditions would be examined to accommodate superhuman prisoners' unique needs.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #36. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Justice===
After his time in the Vault, he adopted the codename '''Justice'''. He briefly went undercover working with [[Shinobi Shaw]] to spy on the activities in the so-called "Younghunt."

When the [[Sphinx (Marvel Comics)#The First Sphinx|Sphinx]], a previous Warriors foe, dispersed members of the team throughout history, Vance encountered his father as an adolescent. He discovered that Arnold, his father, was a [[homosexual]] who was bullied into accepting a [[heterosexual]] lifestyle by his own abusive father. Understanding that his father was as much a victim as he was, Vance attempted to change history by threatening his grandfather, but stopped when he realized that he was, in his own way, perpetuating the cycle of violence handed down from father to son. Though history remained unchanged, this new knowledge allowed Vance to make a measure of peace with the memory of his father.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #47-49. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Justice spent some time in a leadership role with the New Warriors and talked about marriage with Firestar. However, when she learned her microwave powers might render her infertile, such plans were endangered.

===The Avengers===
A mystical incident had caused all those who were once Avengers to be targeted by creatures and monsters. Vance and Angelica accompanied their friend [[Rage (Marvel Comics)|Rage]], who had been an Avenger, to a meeting at Avengers Mansion.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> They willingly helped out in various ways before [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] attacked, altering reality. Vance and Angelica were caught up in the literal mystical maelstrom and were turned into super-powered enforcers under the command of le Fay. However, several Avengers managed to break free of the control, based on their deep belief in the team itself. Vance found himself coming to his senses despite never being an Avenger, a fact that surprised the remaining heroes; thus, he joined the resistance.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #2. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the threat of le Fay was ended and the two proved themselves by defeating [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] on their own, they managed to become Avengers.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #4. Marvel Comics.</ref> Although he was thrilled to be living his lifelong dream of being an Avenger, Vance made some small rookie mistakes at first, stemming from a case of hero worship. However, he proved himself when he came up with a way to defeat the current plans of the current form (or forms) of the villain [[Ultron]], despite a broken leg.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #19–22. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vance and Angelica then spent some time undercover investigating the [[Triune Understanding]], a cult-like movement with seemingly good intentions but a villainous leadership.<ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #28. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, #48. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The Avengers'' vol. 3, Annual 2001. Marvel Comics.</ref>

After the ''[[House of M]]'' ended, Justice and Firestar were unaffected by the [[Decimation (comics)|global depowerment of mutants]] and thus retained their powers.<ref>''X-Men: The 198 Files'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> Vance's wish for more in their relationship, opposed to Firestar's wish for less (being ages 22 and 19 respectively) ended their engagement, and their relationship.<ref>''I ♥ Marvel Marvel: Masked Intentions'' #1 Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Civil War===
Justice and former teammate [[Rage (comics)|Rage]] learned that people were hunting down former New Warriors members because of perceived blame for the deaths caused by [[Nitro (comics)|Nitro]] in [[Stamford, Connecticut]] while fighting an incarnation of the team.<ref>''[[She-Hulk]]'' vol. 2 #8 (July, 2006). Marvel Comics.</ref> They both sought out the legal services of Jennifer Walters ([[She-Hulk]]) in protecting the allies of the New Warriors, as their identities were already publicly exposed. They eventually discovered that former New Warriors member Carlton LaFroyge ([[Hindsight Lad|Hindsight]]) was responsible for the persecution and exposure of their teammates, operating a website that was slowly outing the identities of the twenty or so remaining Warriors.

Both Rage and Justice refused to go along with the proposed super-human registration act. This is further evidenced when they join Captain America's Secret Avengers during the [[Civil War (comic book)|Civil War]] as a result of the death of [[Bill Foster (comics)|Bill Foster]].<ref>''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===The Initiative===
After the Civil War, Justice was recruited by [[Iron Man]] to head the youth outreach arm of [[Fifty State Initiative|The Initiative]] superhero training program, based at [[Camp Hammond (comics)|Camp Hammond]]. He is clearly unaware of some of the shadier aspects of the program, and is growing increasingly irritated by the Initiative "Drill Sergeant" [[Gauntlet (comics)|Gauntlet]]'s constant demeaning and disparaging remarks about the deceased New Warriors.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the investigation of former New Warriors members due to an attack upon Gauntlet, it was revealed to readers that Justice is currently secretly seeing [[Ultra Girl]], a trainee with the Initiative and former New Warriors associate.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #6. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Justice's personal investigation into the fate of Initiative recruit [[Michael Van Patrick|MVP]] opened his eyes to the morally ambiguous activities of the Initiative, instituted by Camp Hammond director [[Henry Peter Gyrich]]. As a result, Justice apparently deserted from the Initiative to continue his investigation, and recruited Ultra Girl, Rage and other former New Warriors [[Debrii]] and [[Slapstick (comics)|Slapstick]] to his cause.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #10. Marvel Comics.</ref> After a [[Michael Van Patrick#KIA|clone of MVP]] goes rogue and leaves the Initiative with major casualties, Justice and these former New Warriors, along with the two surviving Scarlet Spiders, officially inform Iron Man of their intention to quit the Initiative and act as [[Counter Force (Marvel Comics)|Counter Force]], a form of independent oversight for the program; as the group are all registered superhumans, Iron Man is unable to act against Justice's team unless they commit an illegal act. However, Ultra Girl decides to return to the Initiative, apparently ending her relationship with Justice.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #12. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Secret Invasion===
During the [[Secret Invasion|Skrull invasion]], Justice and Counter Force encounter [[Night Thrasher]] ([[Donyell Taylor]]) at the old New Warriors, looking for a DNA sample to prove whether or not the Night Thrasher that died at Stamford was a Skrull imposter. Counter Force initially believe that Donyell is a Skrull, due to his reluctance to reveal his identity, and comes into conflict with Donyell's New Warriors.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #15. Marvel Comics.</ref> When Donyell finally reveals his identity, the two teams join together to storm the S.H.I.E.L.D. helicarrier where the deceased New Warriors bodies were being held, and recover them. The corpse of Night Thrasher is proven to be of human composition, and the two teams bury the bodies outside the old base.<ref>''New Warriors'' vol. 4 #16. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Dark Reign===
When [[Ragnarok (comics)|Ragnarok]], a deranged clone of Thor, attacks Camp Hammond, Counter Force (Now calling themselves "The New Warriors", and boasting Night Thrasher as a member) arrive to help.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #21. Marvel Comics.</ref> During the fight, Ragnarok kills one of the Scarlet Spiders, and nearly kills Vance, who is saved by Ultra Girl. After the battle, Vance retrieves the corpse of the original MVP, seeking to give him a proper burial.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #22. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, their actions in exposing the duplicity to the public, allowed H.A.M.M.E.R. director, [[Norman Osborn]] to shut down Camp Hammond and reorganize the Initiative, placing villains on Initiative teams. The New Warriors rescue Gauntlet and Tigra from the Hood's gang and formed the Avengers Resistance.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #24-25. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Siege===
Things hit the tipping point for the Resistance, when Osborn orchestrates a [[Siege (comics)|siege on Asgard]] by creating an incident similar to Stamford. Justice declares that while most of the Initiative is busy with the Siege, the Resistance will take down Camp H.A.M.M.E.R. in order to expose Osborn once and for all.<ref>''Avengers: The Initiative'' #32. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===Heroic Age===
Vance becomes one of the teaching staff of "[[Avengers Academy]]", alongside former Avengers teammates Hank Pym, Tigra, Quicksilver and former New Warriors teammate Speedball.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #1 (2010). Marvel Comics.</ref> One of his students, [[Veil (comics)|Veil]], has a secret crush on him until she finds out that he has renewed his relationship with [[Ultra Girl]]. His relationship with Ultra Girl is further complicated during the Avengers Academy Prom Night, when Firestar appears.<ref>''Avengers Academy'' #13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

During the "[[Outlawed (comics)|Outlawed]]" storyline, Vance appears as a member of C.R.A.D.L.E. when a law is passed that forbids superheroes who are below the age of 21.<ref>''Outlawed'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Justice is a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] who possesses telekinesis. By using his powers to lift himself, he can levitate and fly at high speed. He has shown the ability to hold a large number of people. Initially, Justice's telekinesis was limited in its scope and using them at the peak level of his power would cause him headaches and nosebleeds.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #1. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The New Warriors'' #3. Marvel Comics.</ref><ref>''The New Warriors'' #5. Marvel Comics.</ref> However, his powers later increased dramatically and he was no longer hindered by the physical symptoms he had once suffered from.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #11-13. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Other versions==
The Vance Astrovik character in an alternate timeline became a founding member of the [[Guardians of the Galaxy (1969 team)|Guardians of the Galaxy]], calling himself [[Vance Astro]]. Marvel has treated this as a separate character from the alternate Earth-691, and the two have even met on occasion.<ref>''The New Warriors'' #68. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==In other media==
On the ''[[Fantastic Four (1994 TV series)|Fantastic Four]]'' animated series, Justice makes a brief cameo at the beginning of the episodes "To Battle the Living Planet" and "Doomsday" alongside [[Darkhawk]].

Justice appears as a non-playable character in ''[[Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2]]'', voiced by Sean Donnellan. He ends up under the control of the nanites and assists [[Rick Jones (comics)|A-Bomb]] in fighting the heroes in Wakanda on the path to the Black Panther's palace.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://marvel.com/news/vgstories.9381.MUA2_NPC_Spotlight~colon~_Firestar_and_Justice |title=Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2: NPC Spotlight on Firestar and Justice &#124; Marvel Heroes Games &#124; Games News &#124; News |publisher=Marvel.com |date=2009-09-02 |access-date=2010-12-29}}</ref> He mentions his past and his relationship with [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]].
