The '''[[Whizzer (comics)|Whizzer]] (Robert Frank)''' is a [[fictional superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. He first appeared during the period that fans and historians call the [[Golden Age of Comic Books]].

The Whizzer has super-speed powers, which (in his original origin story) he acquired from an infusion of [[mongoose]] blood. He appeared in both ''[[USA Comics]]'' and ''[[All Winners Comics]]'' from 1941 to 1946, and was revived by Marvel in the 1970s.

==Publication history==
Robert Frank's incarnation of the Whizzer [[first appearance|debuted]] in ''[[USA Comics]]'' #1 (Aug. 1941), published by [[Timely Comics]]. The character was created by [[penciller]] [[Al Avison]] and an unnamed writer.<ref name=whizcredit>{{cite web|url=http://www.toonopedia.com/whizzer.htm |title=The Whizzer|publisher= [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/5lZ1gqOb4?url=http://www.toonopedia.com/whizzer.htm |archive-date=November 26, 2009|url-status=live}} Source lists "[[Al Avison]] and Al Gabrielle" as that character's creator. However, [http://www.comics.org/issue/1580/ ''USA Comics'' #1 (Aug. 1941)] at the [[Grand Comics Database]] lists Avison as [[penciler]] for the character's debut, and Gabriele solely as [[inker]], not generally considered a co-creator position.</ref> One source credits [[Stan Lee]] as that writer,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lee_s.htm|title=Stan Lee| access-date= 2007-06-09| date= 2006-10-29| publisher=[[Lambiek Comiclopedia]]|archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/62XP0UklS?url=http://www.lambiek.net/artists/l/lee_s.htm | archive-date = October 18, 2011| url-status=live}}</ref> but there are no other sources to support the credit. The Whizzer appeared regularly in ''USA Comics'' through issue #17 (Sept 1945).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/188 |access-date=1 April 2020 |page=189}}</ref>

At the same time, he was also appearing regularly in ''[[All Winners Comics]]'', from issue #2 (Sept 1941) through #21 (Dec 1946). In issues #19 and #21, he was part of the [[All Winners Squad]], a superteam that also included [[Captain America]], [[Bucky Barnes]], the [[Human Torch (android)|Human Torch]], [[Toro (comics)|Toro]], the [[Namor|Sub-Mariner]] and [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]]. These were the character's last appearances during the 1940s.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Benton |first1=Mike |title=Superhero Comics of the Golden Age: The Illustrated History |date=1992 |publisher=Taylor Publishing Company |location=Dallas |isbn=0-87833-808-X |url=https://archive.org/details/superherocomicso0000bent/page/148 |access-date=1 April 2020 |pages=148–149}}</ref>

Writer [[Roy Thomas]] reintroduced the Golden Age Whizzer in ''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1 (Aug. 1974). Two years later, in ''The Avengers Annual'' #6 (Nov. 1976), writer [[Gerry Conway]] reinterpreted the character's origin and history so that the "transfusion of mongoose blood" was not the source of the power, but the factor that "triggered a latent mutant ability". Thomas, in the [[World War II]] [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] series ''[[Invaders (comics)|The Invaders]]'' #5–6 (March–May 1976), expanded on the character's wartime career as a sometime-member of the retroactively created superhero team the Invaders. Thomas later additionally made the Whizzer a full-time member of the home-front heroes the [[Liberty Legion]], in ''[[Marvel Premiere]]'' #29–30 (April–June 1976). Neither team had existed in Timely Comics.

==Fictional character biography==
Robert L. Frank was born in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. The origin of the [[Golden Age of comic books|Golden Age]] character begins while Robert Frank is on a trip to [[Africa]] with his father, Dr. Emil Frank, where Robert is bitten by a [[cobra]]. Dr. Frank saves Robert by a transfusion of [[mongoose]] blood, and soon discovers that his son has developed super-speed.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=68}}</ref> Frank then decides to fight crime and eventually accepts the offer of Invaders member [[Bucky Barnes|Bucky]], who forms the superhero team the [[Liberty Legion]] to rescue the other Invaders, who have been brainwashed by the villain the [[Red Skull]].<ref>''Marvel Premiere'' #29–30 (Apr.–June 1976). Marvel Comics</ref> When the Liberty Legion and Invaders eventually disband after World War II, the Whizzer joins the newly formed [[All-Winners Squad]].<ref>{{Comic book reference | Title = All Winners Comics | Issue = 19 (Fall 1946) & #21 | Date = Winter 1946–47 | Publisher = Timely Comics}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Nevins |first1=Jess |title=Encyclopedia of Golden Age Superheroes |date=2013 |publisher=High Rock Press |isbn=978-1-61318-023-5 |pages=292–293}}</ref> 

The Whizzer afterward spent some years battling alcoholism and depression and was, for some time, homeless in the [[Bowery]] section of [[Manhattan]].<ref name="mnyc">{{cite book | last = Sanderson | first = Peter | title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City | publisher = [[Pocket Books]] | year = 2007 | location = New York City | pages = 18 | isbn = 978-1-4165-3141-8}}</ref> He also works as a nuclear laboratory technician.

In 1942, the Whizzer acquired a new sidekick, a stereotyped African-American friend named Slow-Motion Jones.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mitchell |first1=Kurt |last2=Thomas |first2=Roy |title=American Comic Book Chronicles: 1940-1944 |date=2019 |publisher=TwoMorrows Publishing |isbn=978-1605490892 |page=129}}</ref>

In the modern age, the Whizzer reappears as an aging hero who had married fellow superhero [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]]. The Whizzer encounters and briefly serves with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], who aid him in controlling his son [[Nuklo]]. He is reunited with Nuklo, but suffers a heart attack. At the end of this adventure, the Whizzer erroneously believes himself to be the father of the mutant twins [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]] and [[Scarlet Witch]].<ref>''Giant-Size Avengers'' #1 (Aug. 1974). Marvel Comics.</ref>

The Whizzer was later duped by the [[Living Laser]] into battling the Avengers,<ref>''Avengers'' #152 (Oct. 1976)</ref> and suffers a second heart attack.<ref>''Avengers'' #153 (Nov. 1976).</ref> He then battled the [[Homo mermanus|Atlanteans]] and [[Namor]] alongside the Avengers.<ref>''Avengers'' #155–156 (Jan.–Feb. 1977).</ref> After a humbling defeat at the hands of the supervillain [[Count Nefaria]]<ref>{{Comic book reference| Title = The Avengers| Issue = 165| Date = Nov. 1977| Publisher =}}</ref> the Whizzer retires.<ref>{{Comic book reference| Title = The Avengers| Issue = 173| Date = July 1978| Publisher =}}</ref>

He later returns to fight a final battle against an old war-time foe called [[Isbisa]]. The Whizzer dies after suffering a fatal heart attack while fighting Isbisa, but his sacrifice enables his son Nuklo to be cured of his excessive radiation level and begin a normal life. The Whizzer learned of the still birth of his actual twin babies on Wundagore, and learned he did not father The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, shortly before he died.<ref>{{Comic book reference| Title = The Vision and the Scarlet Witch| Faith of our Fathers| Issue = 2| Date = Dec. 1982| Publisher =}}</ref>

[[Arnim Zola]] later created a proto-husk of Whizzer from his DNA. The Whizzer clone has no lines and is killed by [[Deadpool]] who mocks him as "a legend to make mercs laugh at night".<ref>''Deadpool'' #0 (1998). Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Due to a reaction between his latent genetic mutation and an injection of mongoose blood, Robert Frank has the ability to move at superhuman speed and has superhuman reflexes. He can create cyclones by running in circles, and can run up walls and across water. In his prime, he could attain speeds faster than he could in middle age, running at approximately 100&nbsp;mph.

The Whizzer has learned a unique, self-taught fighting style that exploits the ability to move at superhuman speeds.

==In other media==
* An elderly, long-retired Robert Frank / Whizzer appears in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated television series five-part episode, "Six Forgotten Warriors", voiced by [[Walker Edmiston]]. This version gained his powers from an experiment meant to recreate the process that empowered [[Captain America]] alongside four other individuals who became the [[Black Marvel]], the [[Destroyer (Marvel Comics)|Destroyer]], [[Miss America (Madeline Joyce)|Miss America]], and the [[Thunderer (Marvel Comics)|Thunderer]] during World War II. However, due to the limited nature of their powers, they had to use special rings in order to activate and regulate them. After Captain America apparently sacrificed himself to stop the [[Red Skull]] from activating a doomsday device, Frank and the remaining heroes took the activation keys and retired. In the present, the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s [[Sinister Six|Insidious Six]] attack the retired heroes to steal the keys, leading to the heroes joining forces with [[Spider-Man]] to stop the Kingpin and the Red Skull's forces after the latter resurfaces.
