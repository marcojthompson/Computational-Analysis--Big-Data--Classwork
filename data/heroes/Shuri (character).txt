==Fictional character biography==
The princess of Wakanda, Shuri is [[T'Chaka]]'s youngest child and only daughter. From a very young age, Shuri coveted the Black Panther mantle. She attempts to challenge the then-Black Panther, her uncle S'yan, for the mantle, only to discover that he had already been defeated by her older half-brother [[Black Panther (comics)|T'Challa]].<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #2 (May 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref> During an attack on Wakanda by [[Klaw (Marvel Comics)|Klaw]] and a group of his mercenaries, she uses the [[Ebony Blade]] to defeat the Russian [[Igor Stancheck|Radioactive Man]], killing him in the process. Because she is shell-shocked by her first kill, T'Challa promises to train her in hand-to-hand combat, enabling her to fight on her own terms should she ever need to take his place as leader of Wakanda.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #3-6 (June-Sept. 2005). Marvel Comics.</ref>

While T'Challa and his wife [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Queen Ororo]] are away as members of the [[Fantastic Four]], American [[battleship]]s aligned with [[Erik Killmonger]] moved in on Wakanda. With their King away, Shuri and her advisers decide to sneak onto the ships in the night and incapacitate them. During the raid Shuri is captured by Killmonger's men and thrown in a cell. She challenges Killmonger himself to a fight but, seeing her as beneath him, he sends a group of his men to battle her. She defeats them easily and is broken out of her cell by [[Zuri (comics)|Zuri]], one of T'Challa's advisers.<ref name="BPv4no26-27">''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #26-27 (May–June 2007)</ref> After T'Challa and Ororo leave the Fantastic Four and return to Wakanda, the [[Skrull]]s invade Wakanda as a part of ''[[Secret Invasion]]''. Shuri and her uncle S'yan lead most of the Wakandan army on an assault against the invading Skrulls, while T'Challa and Ororo battle their leaders.<ref name="BPv4no39-41">''Black Panther'' vol. 4 #39-41 (Sept.-Nov. 2008). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Prince [[Namor]] of [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantis]] attempts to recruit T'Challa for the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]], a secret council of [[supervillain]]s run by [[Doctor Doom]]. He rejects the offer but is attacked by the various members, and is left in a [[coma]]tose state. Queen Ororo nominates Shuri as his successor, and she successfully completes the various trials, granting herself access to the heart-shaped herb. However, when she consumes the herb, the Wakandan Panther God does not imbue her with the powers of the Black Panther, instead rejecting her due to her lifelong jealousy of her brother's mantle and her arrogance in its presence.<ref name="BPv5no1-2" /> When the powerful villain [[Morlun]] threatens to annihilate Wakanda entirely, Shuri takes on the Black Panther identity and outfit anyway, and manages to both save Wakanda and resurrect her comatose brother. Through her humble act of self-sacrifice she earns the mantle of the Black Panther, and the Panther God grants her its accompanying powers.<ref name="BPv5no3-6" />

When a now powerless T'Challa discovers that Doctor Doom infected many Wakandan officials and advisers with [[nanite]]s, he goes off in search of a way to stop him, leaving Shuri as acting ruler of Wakanda.<ref name="BPv5no7-8">''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #7-8 (Oct.-Nov. 2009)</ref> Shuri tracks down and fights Namor, trying to discover for herself what part he played in her brother's injuries. Together, T'Challa and Shuri discover that the infected Wakandans, calling themselves the Desturi, intend to stage a [[revolution]], seizing power in Wakanda for themselves.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 5 #9-12 (Dec. 2009-Mar. 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

With Doctor Doom's Desturi successfully overthrowing the incumbent Wakandan government as seen in the ''[[Doomwar]]'' storyline, he finds himself with access to the world's largest supply of vibranium. Shuri and a re-powered T'Challa, who were able to avoid infection from Doom's nanites due to their heightened senses, remain the only Wakandans not under Doom's control. They team up with [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]], and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] of the [[X-Men]] to regain control in Wakanda. They succeed, but Doom steals a large portion of the vibranium. Shuri travels the globe, attempting to destroy Doom's criminal network and recover the stolen vibranium. Doom uses vibranium's inherent mystical qualities to take control of all processed vibranium on the planet, and Shuri and the other heroes attempt to fight and stop him. They succeed when T'Challa uses Doom's own mystical ploys against him, rendering all processed vibranium on the planet inert.<ref name="DW1-6">''Doomwar'' #1-6 (Apr.-Oct. 2010). Marvel Comics.</ref>

With Wakanda struggling economically as seen in the "Klaws of the Panther" storyline, Shuri travels to the [[Savage Land]] to meet with [[Ka-Zar (Kevin Plunder)|Ka-Zar]] and obtain a stock of natural vibranium present there. They are attacked by Klaw, who wants the vibranium for his own use. They defeat him, but a volcanic eruption caused by his sound waves covers the vibranium and renders it unobtainable. She tracks down other stockpiles in [[Madripoor]] and New York, but Klaw already has [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]] troops excavating both sites and fights ensue. Klaw had created a monster called M.U.S.I.C. using the vibranium, and intended to place it on an AIM space station to enslave the world. With help from various other heroes, including Wolverine, [[Spider-Man]] and [[Black Widow (Natalia Romanova)|Black Widow]], Shuri is able to thwart his scheme.<ref>''Klaws of the Panther'' #1-4 (Dec. 2010-Feb. 2011). Marvel Comics.</ref>

Following Namor's attack on Wakanda during ''[[Avengers vs. X-Men]]'', Shuri declares war on Atlantis, despite her brother's protests.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #7. Marvel Comics.</ref> The Wakandans virtually level Atlantis, leaving only a few Atlantean survivors.<ref>{{Cite book |url=http://marvel.com/comics/issue/43522/new_avengers_2013_8 |title=New Avengers Vol. 3 #8 |date=July 24, 2013 |publisher=Marvel}}</ref> In retaliation for Shuri's assault on Atlantis, Namor lies to Thanos’ agents by falsely telling them that the Infinity Gems were located in Wakanda.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://marvel.com/comics/issue/43523/new_avengers_2013_9 |title=New Avengers vol. 3 #9 |date=August 28, 2013 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref> After Wakandan troops were forced to retreat from a counterattack by Thanos’ army, Shuri learns from the [[Dora Milaje]] that T’Challa was in contact with Namor during the Wakandan/Atlantean conflict and that he allowed Namor into the Necropolis several times during the conflict. As a result, Shuri banishes T’Challa from Wakanda's capital city.<ref>{{Cite book |url=https://marvel.com/comics/issue/43526/new_avengers_2013_12 |title=New Avengers vol. 3 #12 |date=November 27, 2013 |publisher=Marvel Comics}}</ref>

During the 2013 "[[Infinity (comic book)|Infinity]]" storyline, it is shown that Shuri is the head of the Wakandan School for Alternative Studies.<ref>''Infinity: The Hunt'' #1. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

When Wakanda is attacked by the [[Cabal (comics)|Cabal]] during the "[[Time Runs Out]]" storyline, Shuri sacrifices herself by staying behind in order to hold off [[Proxima Midnight]] so T'Challa can escape.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #24. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref> Her death is later confirmed when her spirit is seen among those of the past Black Panthers.<ref>''New Avengers'' vol. 3 #29. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

As part of Marvel's 2015 branding [[All-New, All-Different Marvel]], T'Challa is shown trying to revive Shuri's body. Shuri's soul had transcended to the Djalia which was a spiritual plane consisting of the entire memories of Wakanda. There Shuri trained under the tutelage of a griot spirit who had taken the form of her mother, Ramonda. As they trained the griot spirit shared the memories of not only Wakanda but also before the nation had formed. With the help of [[Eden Fesi|Manifold]], T'Challa was able combine his technology and Manifold's bending of reality to bring Shuri's soul back to the physical plane. After her revival Shuri had been imbued with the power similar to that of the griot spirit. She had then been informed of the events taking place in her absence including the rogue Dora Milaje and the rebellion led by Tetu and Zenzi. Shuri had then set out to confront the rogue Dora Milaje and convince them to join forces with T'Challa in order to stop the rebellion and the march against the Golden City, which she was successful in doing. With the united power of Shuri, T'Challa, Manifold, the Dora Milaje and the forces of Wakanda, Tetu was defeated although Zenzi had escaped. As the rebellion came to an end Shuri joined Wakanda's council that had been established by T'Challa.<ref>''Black Panther'' vol. 6 #1. Marvel Comics (New York).</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Shuri is a masterfully fantastic scientist, engineer, and inventor with a genius level of intellect on par with the likes of her brother T'Challa and Tony Stark. Before undergoing the trials to become the Black Panther, Shuri was an extensively trained martial artist.<ref name="BPv4no39-41" /> After the trials, like the Black Panthers before her, Shuri consumed the heart-shaped herb; this granted her enhanced speed, agility, strength, endurance and senses. Her uniform is composed of [[vibranium]].<ref name="BPv5no3-6" />

Through her training underneath the tutelage of a griot spirit while in the Djalia, Shuri had been imbued with new supernatural abilities that allowed her to transform her body into a flexible stone-like material which also granted her an enhanced durability that cannot be dented by normal gunfire or powerful [[directed energy weapons]]. Shuri is also capable of animorphism which allows her to transform herself and whoever she is in direct contact with into a flock of black birds<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black Panther #9 |date=December 2016 |edition=Vol. 6}}</ref> or a singular large dark bird.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black Panther #11 |date=February 2017 |edition=Vol 6.}}</ref>

Shuri's training in the Djalia also imbued her with super-speed<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black Panther vol. 6 #13 |date=April 2017}}</ref> and the ability to temporarily reanimate Wakandan corpses.<ref>{{Cite book |title=Black Panther vol. 6 #15 |date=July 2017}}</ref> Reanimating Wakandan corpses takes a lot of energy from her, meaning she can do it for only a short period of time.

==Other versions==
A character similar to Shuri, T'Challa's younger sister T'Channa, appeared in the [[Marvel Mangaverse]]. She turned her back on the Wakandan people, instead becoming an apprentice and later the successor of Doctor Doom.<ref name="Manga">''Marvel Mangaverse'' #3 (Aug. 2002). Marvel Comics.</ref>
