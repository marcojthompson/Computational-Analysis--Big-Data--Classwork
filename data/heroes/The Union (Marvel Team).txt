The superhero team consists of five members; four of them representing the individual nations of the United Kingdom, and the fifth representing the UK as a whole.<ref name="cbr">{{Cite web|last=Adams|first=Tim|date=February 14, 2020|title=Marvel Introduces The Union, The UK's Brand-New Superhero Team|url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-comics-the-union-united-kingdom-superhero-team/|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|website=Comic Book Resources}}</ref>

She is described as having "a voice that can shatter stone". During the attack on Earth by [[Knull (character)|Knull]], the Choir is infected by a symbiote. She is freed of Knull's control through the efforts of the Union, but later defects to work alongside Doc Croc and his team.
