Retrieved August 22, 2017.</ref>

Sir Percy appeared in [[Mystic Arcana]], representing the element of earth.

== Fictional character biography ==
The original Black Knight is '''Sir Percy of [[Scandia]]''', a 6th-century knight who serves at the court of [[King Arthur (Marvel Comics)|King Arthur Pendragon]] as his greatest warrior and one of the Knights of the Round Table.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Misiroglu |first1=Gina |title=The Superhero Book: The Ultimate Encyclopedia of Comic-Book Icons and Hollywood Heroes |date=2012 |publisher=Visible Ink Press |isbn=9781578593972 |page=60}}</ref> Recruited by the wizard [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)#Merlin of Legend|Merlin]], Percy adopts a double identity, and pretends to be totally incompetent until changing into the persona of the Black Knight. As the Black Knight, Percy wields the '''[[Ebony Blade]]''', which Merlin forged from a meteorite.<ref>''Black Knight'' #1–5 (May–Dec. 1955), [[Atlas Comics (1950s)|Atlas Comics]], the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics.</ref> A constant foe of the evil knight [[Mordred (comics)|Mordred the Evil]] (Arthur's traitorous "nephew") and [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]], in time Sir Percy retired his dual identity and married Lady Rosamund.

Percy is eventually killed at Castle Scandia by Mordred during the fall of Camelot when stabbed from behind with an enchanted blade made of the same material as his own Ebony Blade – although Mordred then dies himself of wounds inflicted by Arthur during the [[Battle of Camlann]] earlier that day.<ref name="msh">''[[Marvel Super-Heroes (comics)|Marvel Super-Heroes]]'' #17 (Nov. 1968)</ref> Merlin ensures that Percy's spirit will live on by casting a spell that will revive his ghost if Mordred should ever return.

Sir Percy was survived by a son, Geoffrey. Lady Rosamund later gave birth to his second son, Edward the Posthumous, who reportedly became ancestor of "a proud lineage". Several of Sir Percy's descendants adopted the identity of the Black Knight: '''Sir Raston''', active during the late 6th and early 7th century, who eventually became an agent of the [[time travel]]er [[Kang the Conqueror]]; and '''Sir Eobar Garrington''', a 12th-century knight serving under [[Richard I of England|Richard the Lionheart]] during the [[Third Crusade]].

Percy's spirit has appeared several times to counsel his descendant, [[Black Knight (Dane Whitman)|Dane Whitman]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=52}}</ref> He first appeared as a spirit to act as a mentor to Dane, revealing the circumstances of his death,<ref>''Marvel Super-Heroes'' #17 (1968)</ref> and appeared a number of times subsequently as a spirit, summoned to give advice.<ref>''The Avengers'' #71; ''The Avengers'' #84; ''The Avengers'' #100</ref> Percy was eventually released from the mortal plane by [[Doctor Strange]].<ref>''Doctor Strange'' vol. 2 #2</ref>

Percy's spirit again appeared to Dane Whitman, revealing how he wed Lady Rosamund. His spirit then took possession of Dane's body.<ref>''Black Knight'' #1</ref> With Doctor Strange, he fought Morgan le Fay and Balor, and was rescued by [[Valkyrie (Marvel Comics)|Valkyrie]]. He then made [[Bloodwraith|Sean Dolan]] his squire.<ref>''Black Knight'' #3</ref> Percy's spirit then took possession of the Ebony Blade itself.<ref>''Black Knight'' #4</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
The Black Knight was an athletic man with no superhuman powers. He was a master of swordsmanship, horseback riding and all forms of combat known in Britain at the time of Camelot. He was also a talented poet, singer and musician with the lute.

Percy wielded the [[Ebony Blade]], and [[Merlin (Marvel Comics)|Merlin]]'s spells rendered the Black Knight invulnerable to physical harm as long as he held the Ebony Blade. However, the spells were ineffective against a weapon made of the same metal as the Ebony Blade. He also wore body armor and a helmet which were similarly rendered impenetrable by Merlin's spells.
