'''Jean Grey''' is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] featured in seven films in the ''[[X-Men (film series)|X-Men]]'' film series, starting with ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]'' (2000) and ending with ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' (2019). Jean was portrayed by Dutch actress [[Famke Janssen]] in five films, with "Jean" in ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'' (2013) being a posthumous hallucination in [[Logan (film series character)|Logan]]'s head and her appearance in ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) being a brief flashforward scene. For the 2016 film ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'', Jean was recast with English actress [[Sophie Turner]], who would reprise her role in ''Dark Phoenix'' in 2019.

==Fictional character biography==
{{expand section|date=September 2021}}
<!---Remember to keep it brief though! This is not Fandom, so brief detail of her character arc will do.--->

===Early life===

''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' and ''Dark Phoenix'' each has a [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]] sequence for Jean; because of the events of ''X-Men: Days of Future Past'', these two flashbacks takes place in two different realities.<ref>{{cite web | title=The X-Men Timeline | url=https://the-artifice.com/x-men-timeline/ |  publisher=The Artifice | date=November 29, 2019 | access-date=September 9, 2020}}</ref>

In the original timeline, Jean is visited by Charles Xavier ([[Patrick Stewart]]) and Erik Lehnsherr ([[Ian McKellen]]) after her parents had been concerned about what they believed to be a type of "illness" in their daughter. The girl is shown levitating multiple cars and other objects with her telekinetic powers and the two elder mutants, still friends at the time, invite Jean to the [[X-Mansion|Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters]]. The professor later explains that while she was young, he put psychic dampers on her mind to help control a supposed "dark side" within her subconscious, preventing her powers from spiraling out of control and hurting others and herself.<ref name="laststand" group=P>{{cite AV media | title=[[X-Men: The Last Stand]] | date=May 26, 2006 | publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] | people=[[Brett Ratner]] (director); [[Simon Kinberg]] & [[Zak Penn]] (writers)}}</ref>

In the second timeline, Jean is in a car with her parents, causing a car crash with her out-of-control mental powers, killing her mother and leaving her father afraid of his own daughter and refusing to see her later on; Jean is led to believe that her father also died in the crash. She is approached by Charles Xavier ([[James McAvoy]]), who tries to help the troubled girl, inviting her to enroll in his school.<ref name="darkphoenix" group=P>{{cite AV media | title=[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]] | date=June 7, 2019 | publisher=[[20th Century Fox]] | people=[[Simon Kinberg]] (director and writer)}}</ref>

==Background and creation==

===Development===

The casting call for the first ''X-Men'' film specifies Jean Grey's character as a "''Beautiful and intelligent scientist. Also an X-Man. She has telepathic and telekinetic powers. Engaged to Cyclops and yearned for by Wolverine. Late 20s''".<ref>{{cite web | title=X-MEN casting call desires... | url=http://legacy.aintitcool.com/node/3588 | date=May 11, 1999 | access-date=September 9, 2020 | publisher=[[Ain't It Cool News]]}}</ref> Reports from pre-production in 1999 indicated that Jean being written to be a scientist - which she is not in the comics - was due to Beast/Hank McCoy, the team's resident scientist, originally being part of the script but dropped due to budget concerns.<ref>{{cite web | title=X-Men - Second Archive | url=http://www.corona.bc.ca/films/details/xmenB.html | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000817034140/http://www.corona.bc.ca/films/details/xmenB.html | archive-date=August 17, 2000 | url-status=dead | publisher=Coming Attractions}}</ref> Since director [[Bryan Singer]] had gone with a younger, teenage portrayal of [[Rogue (Marvel Comics)|Rogue]] ([[Anna Paquin]]), he felt that he wanted a more mature Jean in contrast.<ref>{{cite magazine | magazine=[[Cinefantastique]] | volume=32 | issue=2 | date=August 2000 | title=X-Men: Filming Marvel superheroes | author=Paul Wardle | pages=12â€“22}}</ref>

''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' was originally meant to be a pure adaption of ''[[The Dark Phoenix Saga]]'' storyline from the comics, but [[Tom Rothman]] considered [[Simon Kinberg]]'s first outline to be "too dark, too weird, and, potentially, too expensive", and hired ''X2'' screenwriter [[Zak Penn]] to do a rewrite; Rothman was insistent upon forcing a secondary plot, that of a cure for mutants, into the film. 20th Century Fox, which owned the film rights to the X-Men franchise, was also wary of going for a film with a female lead, as its own film ''[[Elektra (2005 film)|Elektra]]'' (2005), as well as the [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]' film ''[[Catwoman (film)|Catwoman]]'' (2004), were both critical failures while ''Catwoman'' was also a [[box-office bomb]]. Rothman feared that the nature of the [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix Force]], being akin to a giant cosmic bird, would not appeal to the masses in a cinematic setting and decided to cut that portrayal of Jean's powers.

He also noted that Jean Grey would have committed suicide by the end, which was redundant with the ending of ''X2''. The "Dark Phoenix" storyline was thus relegated to a secondary substory in ''The Last Stand''. Simon Kinberg was disappointed by this outcome, calling the Dark Phoenix Saga "the ultimate X-Men story" and compared reducing it to a secondary subplot to sidelining the [[Book of Genesis]] chapter from [[The Bible]].<ref>{{cite web | title=The X-Men's Never-Ending 'Dark Phoenix Saga' Saga | url=https://www.theringer.com/movies/2019/6/6/18653935/dark-phoenix-x-men-adaptation-comic-books-chris-claremont-last-stand-animated-series | publisher=[[The Ringer (website)|The Ringer]] | author=Thomas Golianopoulos | date=June 6, 2019 | access-date=September 16, 2019}}</ref> At one point, [[Matthew Vaughn]] (the original director of ''The Last Stand'' before Brett Ratner took over) wanted Wolverine to carry [[Leech (comics)|Leech]] with him to Jean to depower her; Penn felt that this was a cop-out and Jean had to pay for her crimes, and depowering her would also not fix her broken state of mind.<ref>{{cite web | title=Q&A: X-Men 3 writers Zak Penn and Simon Kinberg | url=http://new.hollywoodgothique.com/x-men-3-writers-speak-2/ | publisher=Hollywood Gothique | author=Steve Biodrowski | date=June 12, 2006 | access-date=September 16, 2020}}</ref>

The 2019 ''Dark Phoenix'' film was originally meant to be a two part storyline, one film named only ''Phoenix'' and then ''Dark Phoenix'' as its sequel. However, the producers were unhappy with the outcome of ''X-Men: Apocalypse'' and cancelled the second sequel, forcing Simon Kinberg to compress his storyline into one film. His original ending had Jean dying at the end, but this ending was poorly received with test audiences for the film and was changed to a more hopeful outcome.<ref name="popmatters2020">{{cite web | title='X-Men: Dark Phoenix' Will Never Rise from the Ashes | url=https://www.popmatters.com/simon-kinberg-xmen-dark-phoenix-2647050051.html | publisher=[[PopMatters]] | author=Michael Curley | date=August 26, 2020 | access-date=September 13, 2020}}</ref>

===Characterization and special effects===
<!-- Only effects that concern Jean specifically, please... --->
In ''X-Men: The Last Stand'', Jean's appearance when the Phoenix takes control was created by [[John Bruno (special effects)|John Bruno]] working with [[Moving Picture Company]]. MPC used [[particle system]]s to create the effect of Jean's hair seemingly moving when the Phoenix effect takes over. MPC made hundreds of skin and eye treatments and used a 3D model of Famke Janssen's face when [[compositing]] them into Jean's digital makeup. According to [[Nicolas Aithadi]] (MPC),

:The idea was that when the Dark Phoenix is taking over, Jean's skin darkens, veining appears on her face, and her eyes go black. We went through hundreds of iterations with different degrees of darkness, with more or fewer visible veins. At the end, we went for a 'less is more' look and made the effect more sublle - but still enough to give Jean a scary look.<ref name="cinefex">{{cite journal |title=Dark Phoenix Rising |first=Jody |last=Duncan |journal=[[Cinefex]] |issue=106 |date=July 2006 |pages=36â€“65}}</ref>

==Reception==

The Jean Grey from the first 2000 film was released as an action figure by [[Toy Biz]] in 2000. The figure has been criticized as "a static, unflattering, and oddly posed representation of Famke Janssen".<ref>{{cite web | title=10 Worst X-Men Action Figures, Ranked | url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-worst-x-men-action-figures-ranked/ | publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]] | website=cbr.com | author=Darby Harn | date=May 24, 2020 | access-date=September 19, 2020}}</ref> The 2007 "Dark Phoenix" version of Jean Grey from ''X-Men: The Last Stand'' has been released as an action figure in ''[[Marvel Legends]]'' series.<ref>{{cite web | title=Jean Grey (X3) - Marvel Legends - Blob Series - Hasbro Action Figure | url=https://www.figurerealm.com/actionfigure?action=actionfigure&id=10168&figure=jeangreyx3 | date=May 18, 2008 | access-date=September 19, 2020 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151009220112/https://www.figurerealm.com/actionfigure?action=actionfigure&id=10168&figure=jeangreyx3 | archive-date=October 9, 2015 | url-status=live}}</ref>

Both Janssen and Turner received award nominations for their respective performances of the character.
