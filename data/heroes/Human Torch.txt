The '''Human Torch (Jonathan "Johnny" Storm)''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character is a founding member of the [[Fantastic Four]]. He is writer [[Stan Lee]]'s and artist [[Jack Kirby]]'s reinvention of a similar, previous character, the [[Human Torch (android)|android Human Torch]] of the same name and powers who was created in 1939 by writer-artist [[Carl Burgos]] for Marvel Comics' predecessor company, [[Timely Comics]].

Like the rest of the Fantastic Four, Johnny gained his powers on a spacecraft bombarded by [[cosmic ray]]s. He can engulf his entire body in flames, fly, absorb fire harmlessly into his own body, and control any nearby fire by sheer force of will. "Flame on!", which the Torch customarily shouts when activating his full-body flame effect, has become his [[catchphrase]]. The youngest of the group, he is brash and impetuous in comparison to his reticent, overprotective and compassionate older sister, [[Invisible Woman|Susan Storm]], his sensible brother-in-law, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], and the grumbling [[Thing (comics)|Ben Grimm]]. In the early 1960s, he starred in a series of solo adventures, published in ''[[Strange Tales]]''. The Human Torch is also a friend and frequent ally of the superhero [[Spider-Man]], who is approximately the same age.

In films, the Human Torch has been portrayed by [[Jay Underwood]] in the unreleased 1994 film ''[[The Fantastic Four (unreleased film)|The Fantastic Four]]''; [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] in the 2005 film ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'', and its 2007 sequel ''[[Fantastic Four: Rise of the Silver Surfer]]''; and [[Michael B. Jordan]] in the 2015 film ''[[Fantastic Four (2015 film)|Fantastic Four]]''.

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], Johnny Storm is a renovation of [[Carl Burgos]]'s original character, the [[Human Torch (android)|android Human Torch]], created for [[Timely Comics]] in 1939. Storm first appeared in ''[[Fantastic Four (comic book)|The Fantastic Four]]''<!--first 15 issues titled "The" Fantastic Four--> #1 ([[cover-date]]d Nov. 1961), establishing him as a member of the titular [[superhero]] team. In his plot summary for this first issue, Lee passed on to Kirby that the recently formed [[Comics Code Authority]] had told him that the Human Torch was only permitted to burn objects, never people.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Batchelor |first1=Bob |title=Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel |date=2017 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781442277816 |pages=73–74}}</ref> Over the course of the series, Johnny being the little brother of teammate Susan Storm a.k.a. the Invisible Girl was one of several sources of tension within the group.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Batchelor |first1=Bob |title=Stan Lee: The Man Behind Marvel |date=2017 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=9781442277816 |page=xiii}}</ref>

Additionally, he starred in a solo feature in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #101-134 (Oct. 1962 – July 1965).<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/824/ ''Strange Tales''] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref> An eight-issue series, ''The Human Torch'' (Sept. 1974 – Nov. 1975), reprinted stories from that solo feature, along with stories featuring the original android Human Torch.<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/2177/ ''The Human Torch'', Marvel, 1974 series] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> Later years also saw a 12-issue series, ''Human Torch'' (June 2003 - June 2004) by writer [[Karl Kesel]] and [[penciler]] [[Skottie Young]],<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/10987/ ''Human Torch'', Marvel, 2003 series] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref> and the five-issue team-up miniseries ''Spider-Man / Human Torch'' (March–July 2005) by writer [[Dan Slott]] and penciler [[Ty Templeton]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/series/12807/ ''Spider-Man / Human Torch''] at the Grand Comics Database.</ref>

The Human Torch was originally the permanent co-star of ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'', but was dropped after three issues because the creators found this format too restrictive.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|date=October 2010|title=Spider-Man and Company: The Wide World of Marvel Team-Up|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=#44| pages=33–39|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}</ref> He co-starred in two [[one-shot (comics)|one-shot]] comics, ''Spider-Man & the Human Torch in...

==Fictional character biography==
===Early life===
Growing up in Glenville, New York, a fictional [[Long Island]] suburban town, Johnny Storm lost his mother due to a car accident from which his father, surgeon [[Franklin Storm]], escaped unharmed.<ref name="ReferenceA">''Fantastic Four'' #32 - "Death of a Hero"</ref> Franklin Storm spiraled into alcoholism and financial ruin, and was imprisoned after killing a loan shark in self-defense. Johnny Storm was then raised by his older sister, [[Invisible Woman|Sue Storm]].

Original pencil art by [[Jack Kirby]] and unconfirmed inker. Alterations by [[Sol Brodsky]].<ref>[http://www.comics.org/issue/17360/ ''Fantastic Four Annual'' #1] at the [[Grand Comics Database]].</ref>]]
At 16, Storm joined his sister and her fiancé, [[Mister Fantastic|Reed Richards]], in a space flight in which [[cosmic radiation]] transformed those three and spacecraft pilot [[Ben Grimm]] into superpowered beings who would become the celebrated [[superhero]] team the [[Fantastic Four]]. Storm, with the ability to become a flaming human with the power of flight and the ability to project fire, dubs himself the Human Torch, in tribute to the [[World War II]]-era hero of that name.<ref>''The Fantastic Four'' #1</ref> In ''The Fantastic Four'' #4, it is Storm who discovers an [[amnesia]]c [[hobo]] whom he helps regain his memory as the [[antihero]] [[Namor the Sub-Mariner]], one of the three most popular heroes of Marvel Comics' 1940s forerunner, [[Timely Comics]], returning him to modern continuity.

Though a member of a world-famous team, Storm still lived primarily in Glenville and attended Glenville High School. Here he thought he maintained a [[secret identity]], although his fellow townsfolk were well aware of his being a member of the Fantastic Four and simply humored him. This series introduced what would become the recurring Fantastic Four foes the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]<ref>''Strange Tales'' #102</ref> and [[Trapster|Paste-Pot Pete]], later known as the Trapster.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #104</ref> In Storm's home life, Mike Snow, a member of the high-school wrestling squad, bullied Storm until an accidental flare-up of the Torch's powers scarred Snow's face. Storm dated fellow student Dorrie Evans, although she eventually grew tired of his constant disappearances and broke off their relationship.<ref>Various issues, ''Strange Tales'' #113 to ''Fantastic Four'' #45 (Dec. 1965)</ref>

===College===

After graduating high school, Storm enrolled at New York City's Metro College.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #35 (Feb. 1965)</ref> There he befriended his roommate [[Wyatt Wingfoot]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #50</ref> He also met the [[Human Torch (android)|original Human Torch]] of the 1930s and 1940s.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' Annual #4</ref> Around this time, Storm met and fell in love with [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], a member of the superpowered race the [[Inhumans]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #45 (Dec. 1965)</ref> After their relationship ended, Crystal returned to her native city of Attilan and eventually married the superhero [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]],<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #150 (Sept. 1974)</ref> Storm, crushed, attempted to move on, finding that his high-school girlfriend, Dorrie Evans, had married and had two children.{{Issue|date=June 2010}} Storm dropped out of college but remained friends with Wingfoot, who often participated in the Fantastic Four's adventures.

Storm eventually began a romance with who he thought was [[Alicia Masters]] but was eventually revealed to be an alien from the shapeshifting Skrull race, [[Lyja]], posing as Masters.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #269-270</ref> In the interim, they married.<ref>"Dearly Beloved", by [[Roger Stern]], [[John Buscema]], and [[Sal Buscema]]. ''Fantastic Four'' #300 (March 1987).</ref> Storm later discovers "Alicia's" true identity, and that Lyja is pregnant with his child. He then witnessed Lyja's apparent death and rescued the real Alicia from the Skrulls.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #357-358</ref>

Storm briefly joined his nephew [[Franklin Richards (Fantastic Four)|Franklin Richards]]' [[Fantastic Force]] team, where he battled his otherdimensional counterpart, Vangaard (formerly Gaard). [[Lyja]] posed as student Laura Green and dated Storm to stay close to him; Storm recognized her when they kissed, though he did not reveal this to her until later.{{Issue|date=June 2010}}

===Outside career and anti-registration movement===
Seeking an acting career, Storm was cast as the [[Old West]] hero the [[Rawhide Kid]], but producers reconsidered and gave the role to Lon Zelig (actually the alien [[Super-Skrull]]). After working mostly in some television shows, Storm also spent some time as a firefighter at the behest of his former classmate, Mike Snow,{{Issue|date=May 2016}} but when Snow moved away after his wife turned out to be a [[psychopath]]ic [[arson]]ist and seemingly died, Storm left the job. He later returned to the profession during a period when the Fantastic Four was short on cash.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Civil War|publisher=Marvel Comics|year=2011|location=New York, New York.}}</ref>{{Issue|date=November 2020}} Frustrated with her brother's directionless life and near-disastrous pranksterism, his sister compelled him to become [[chief financial officer]] for the Fantastic Four, Inc. Infighting and betrayal resulted in a near-catastrophe, ending Storm's position.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' vol. 3, #65-66</ref>

After a major battle with the supervillain and dictator [[Doctor Doom]], Fantastic Four leader [[Reed Richards]] attempted to claim Doom's [[Latveria]] for the Fantastic Four, an act that alienated the [[United States government]] and his own team. This led to team-member [[Ben Grimm]]'s apparent death and the Fantastic Four's subsequent dispersal. Storm took to fixing cars for a living. Grimm later was revealed to be alive.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #509-511</ref> Over the Internet, Storm meets a young woman, Cole, whom he learns is the daughter of one of the Fantastic Four's oldest enemies, the [[Wizard (Marvel Comics)|Wizard]]; after a confrontation with that supervillain, who escaped with Cole, Storm remained hopeful of meeting her again.<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #514-516</ref> For a time, Storm became the Herald of the powerful cosmic being [[Galactus]], becoming the Invisible Boy after switching powers with his sister and teammate, Susan Richards, the [[Invisible Woman]].<ref>''Fantastic Four'' #517-524</ref>

During the 2006–2007 "[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]" company-wide crossover, in which the superpowered community is split over the [[Superhuman Registration Act]], which required them to register with, and become agents of, the US government, Storm and his sister allied with the underground rebels, the [[Secret Avengers]].<ref>[[Mark Millar|Millar, Mark]]. ''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #4, Marvel Comics, Oct. 2006</ref> Shortly afterward, during the "[[Secret Invasion]]" company-wide crossover, the shape-shifting extraterrestrial [[Skrulls]] intensified their clandestine infiltration of Earth. Storm was briefly reunited with his former Skrull girlfriend, [[Lyja]]. Though part of the invading force, she finds she still has some feelings for him, and does not carry out her mission of sabotage. She returns to her people, unsure of herself and of any future relationship.<ref>''Secret Invasion: Fantastic Four'' #1-3</ref>

===Death and return===
In the conclusion of the 2011 "Three" storyline, in ''Fantastic Four'' #587 (March 2011), the Human Torch appears to die fighting a horde of aliens from the otherdimensional [[Negative Zone]]. The series ended with the following issue, #588, and relaunched in March 2011 as simply ''FF''.<ref name=JohnnyDeath1>{{cite web |last=Ching |first=Alber |url=http://blog.newsarama.com/2011/01/25/associated-press-spoils-fantastic-four-587-hours-before-comic-goes-on-sale/ |title=Associated Press Spoils 'Fantastic Four' #587 Hours Before Comic Goes on Sale |publisher=Newsarama.com |date=January 25, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616160700/http://blog.newsarama.com/2011/01/25/associated-press-spoils-fantastic-four-587-hours-before-comic-goes-on-sale/ |archive-date=June 16, 2013 }}</ref><ref name=JohnnyDeath2>Ching, Albert.

It is later revealed that the Human Torch was revived by a species of insect-like creatures that were implanted in his body by [[Annihilus]] in an attempt to force Storm to help open the Negative Zone portal.

==Romance==<!-- This section is linked from [[Shapeshifting]] -->
The Human Torch has been involved in several romantic relationships throughout the years, including, but not limited to, the [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Crystal (comics)|Crystal]], member-in-training and future [[Galactus]] herald [[Frankie Raye]], the [[Skrull]] agent [[Lyja]] disguised as [[Alicia Masters]], the [[Atlantis (Marvel Comics)|Atlantean]] [[Namorita]], [[Inhumans|Inhuman]] [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]], and [[X-Men]] member [[Rogue (comics)|Rogue]].

==Powers and abilities==
Johnny Storm gained a number of superhuman powers as a result of the mutagenic effects of the cosmic radiation he was exposed to, all of which are related to fire. His primary ability to envelop his body in fiery plasma without harm to himself, in which form he is able to fly by providing thrust behind himself with his own flame, and to generate powerful streams and/or balls of flame. He can also manipulate his flame in such a way as to shape it into rings and other forms, such as a fiery duplicate of himself that he can remotely control. Even when not engulfed in flame himself, Storm has the ability to control any fire within his immediate range of vision, causing it to increase or decrease in intensity or to move in a pattern directed by his thoughts. Additionally, he is able to absorb fire/plasma into his body with no detrimental effects.

The plasma field immediately surrounding his body is hot enough to vaporize projectiles that approach him, including bullets. He does not generally extend this flame-aura beyond a few inches from his skin, so as not to ignite nearby objects. Storm refers to his maximum flame output as his "nova flame", which he can release omnidirectionally. Flame of any temperature lower than this cannot burn or harm the Torch. This "nova" effect can occur spontaneously when he absorbs an excessive amount of heat, although he can momentarily suppress the release when necessary, with considerable effort.<ref>''Strange Tales'' #112/1</ref>

Storm has demonstrated enough control with fire that he can safely shave another's hair,<ref>{{Cite comic| writer = [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]| penciller = [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]| inker = [[Sol Brodsky|Brodsky, Sol]]| colorist = [[Stan Goldberg|Goldberg, Stan]]| letterer = [[Artie Simek|Simek, Artie]]| editor = Lee, Stan| story = Chapter 2 Enter the Sub-Mariner!| title = [[Fantastic Four (comic book)|Fantastic Four]]| volume = 1| issue = #4| date = May 1962| publisher = [[Canam Publishers Sales Corp.]]| location = [[New York, NY]]| page = | panel = | id =| url = https://www.comics.org/issue/16933/#437830}}</ref> or hold a person while in his flame form without his passenger feeling discomforting heat. His knowledge extends to general information about fire as well, supported by regular visits to fire-safety lectures at various firehouses in New York. In one instance when poisoned, Storm superheated his blood to burn the toxin out.<ref>''Spider-Man/Human Torch'' #2</ref>

Storm's ability to ignite himself is limited by the quantity of [[oxygen]] in his environment, and his personal flame has been extinguished by sufficient quantities of water, flame retardant foam, and vacuum environments. He can reignite instantly once oxygen is returned, with no ill effects. In early stories he could only remain aflame for up to five minutes at a time, after which he would need five minutes to recharge before igniting himself again.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Stan |title=Epic Collection: Fantastic Four: The World's Greatest Comic Magazine |date=2014 |publisher=Mavel Comics |isbn=978-0-7851-8832-2 |page=440}}</ref>

Storm was depicted as transmuting his body itself into living flame in the first two issues of ''The Fantastic Four''.<!--first 15 issues had "The" in cover title--> In all subsequent appearances, his power consists in the generation of a flaming aura.

===Marvel Mangaverse===
In the [[Marvel Mangaverse]] comics, the Human Torch is portrayed by two separate characters spanning two very different continuities. The first character is a member of the Megascale Metatalent Response Team Fantastic Four on Earth-2301a and the mirror opposite of Earth-616's Johnny Storm in terms of personality. The team uses power-packs to boost their talents to manifest at [[mecha]]-sized levels in order to combat [[Godzilla]]-sized monsters that seem to constantly attack Earth. In volume two of Mangaverse, which takes place on Earth-2301b, the character of Johnny Storm has been replaced with a young woman named Jonatha Storm, who is the half-sister of [[Invisible Woman|Sioux Storm]]. Jonatha is quite hotheaded; sometimes riding into battle singing "I am the Goddess of Hellfire." She denies being impulsive, saying she can only be described that way in comparison to her "neurotic" teammates. In ''New Mangaverse'' Jonatha is slightly redesigned to look a few years younger than she did in volume one of Mangaverse, and no longer wears her hair in multiple braids, instead sporting two pigtails on each side of her head. After witnessing the murder of the other Fantastic 4 members by supernatural assassins, she joins [[Spider-Man]], [[Spider-Woman]] ([[Mary Jane Watson]]), [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]], [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]], and [[Iron Man]], in hopes of getting [[revenge]].{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===Marvel Zombies===
In this alternative universe crazed [[Reed Richards]] recently infects Johnny Storm, [[Sue Storm]], and [[Ben Grimm]] with the zombie virus. The three then turn Reed into a zombie and the four of them go on a rampage with the other zombies. Eventually Reed contacts the Ultimate Reed and gets him to come to the infected universe.

===Ultimate Marvel===
In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] Universe, Johnny Storm is the youngest child of Franklin Storm, but is not as intelligent as his sister and father. He spent time at the Baxter Building, but his rebellious nature meant that he learned little from his time spent there.  Although he is portrayed as being very vain, [[narcissistic]], and displays some [[misogynistic]] tendencies, he is also shown to have a deep devotion to his friends and family. He is good friends with Spider-Man, and has a friendship/friendly rivalry with [[Iceman (comics)|Bobby Drake]] due to each other's respective powers.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

He is present at Reed Richards' test of the N-Zone Teleportation Device in the Nevada Desert. After a malfunction in the device, he wakes up in France in a hospital bed. He uncontrollably bursts into flames until he learns to control his powers by saying "Flame On" and "Flame Off.". When [[Mole Man]]'s creatures attacks, Johnny finds out he can fly while on fire. It is explained by Reed that Johnny's combustion makes him lighter than air. Johnny's body is covered with a microscopically thin film of transparent plates that make him impervious to flame. When he activates his powers, fat cells beneath his skin create clean nuclear fusion and jet out between the plates as plasma which then ignites on contact with air. Periodically, Johnny enters a hibernation where his old layer of skin peels off as ash while a new layer forms underneath. Unlike the mainstream Human Torch, Ultimate Johnny's power sometimes have detrimental effects on his health, specifically causing unhealthy levels of weight loss and exhaustion.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In issues #68 and 69 of ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', Johnny meets Spider-Man when his sister says he has to finish high school.  Johnny picks a school in Queens which happens to be Midtown High. He quickly meets and becomes friends with Peter Parker, [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] and [[Liz Allan]]. At a bonfire, he catches fire and scares off Liz Allan.  He arranges to meet Liz, but she does not show up.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Encouraged by Mary Jane, Spider-Man shows up instead and gives Johnny a heart-to-heart talk about great power and great responsibility. Together, they save people from a burning building when Johnny absorbs the flames. Spider-Man shows Johnny that they will not always be appreciated by the public.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In issue #98 of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', the Fantastic Four learn Spider-Man's identity, and Johnny recognizes Peter.  In issue #101, Nick Fury and a regiment of [[Spider-Slayer|Spider Slayers]] try to arrest Peter but are stopped by Johnny and the rest of the Fantastic Four.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In the "Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends" story arc (beginning with issue #118 and concluding in issue #120) Johnny returns to Midtown High wanting to spend time with real friends after becoming frustrated on a date with a popular pop-star who only came for publicity. After some prodding, Johnny arranges for a group consisting of himself, Peter, Mary Jane, Kitty Pryde, Kong, Bobby Drake and Liz Allan (Johnny's apparent romantic interest) to have a somewhat normal day at the beach. During the evening bonfire, mirror his last visit, Liz Allan bursts into flame, exposing herself as a mutant. At the end of the arc, Liz returns to the Xaiver Institute with Iceman.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

In Issue #129 of ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', Johnny attends another unsuccessful date with the same pop-star as before and after again becoming frustrated calls Peter Parker to give him an excuse to leave. Johnny laments that he does not know any nice girls and has no real way of meeting any, and wants Peter to set him up. After flying off, he encounters The Vulture mid-robbery. Johnny attempts to stop him, but is thwarted several times before being assisted by [[Spider-Woman]] (a female clone of Peter Parker who is still mentally Peter up to the point of her "birth" in the Clone Saga story arc, a fact not disclosed to Johnny). Johnny proceeds to follow her around asking her for details about who she is, going as far to flirt with her. The very embarrassed Spider-Woman swings off.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Throughout the first story arc of ''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' (the continuation of ''Ultimate Spider-Man''), Johnny Storm appears at Peter Parker's door and passes out in his arms. When he wakes up he informs Aunt May that he does not wish to return to the Baxter Building. Aunt May decides to let him live with her, Peter and Gwen (later also adding Bobby Drake to the household as well). As to not raise suspicion and to not reveal Peters' secret identity, Aunt May comes up with the idea of coloring Johnny's hair black and changing his name to Johnny Parker, Peter's cousin. She then enrolls him and Bobby at Midtown High along with Peter and Gwen. The school is then attacked by a Spider-Slayer, created by Mysterio, to hunt down Spider-Man. Johnny runs away from the school before "Flaming On", as to not reveal his new secret identity, then returns to aid Peter in the fight, only to discover that the Shroud has already taken care of it. Johnny decides to melt the remains of the Spider-Slayer anyway.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Later when Norman Osborn escapes alongside The Vulture, Kraven the Hunter, Electro, Doctor Octopus, and The Sandman, Johnny and Bobby find them at Peters home and Johnny manages to knock Osborn unconscious before sandman does the same to him. Spider-Man then wakes him up to fight Osborn again but Johnny only succeeds in adding to Osborn's power before being knocked out yet again. Afterwards Spider-Man is killed after defeating Osborn and the other supervillains and Johnny is the one who checks to see if he truly is dead.{{issue|date=February 2013}}
Ultimate Johnny appears briefly in issue one of Ultimate Fallout. In this issue, distressed by Peter's death he screams and releases most of his energy above the city.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

Johnny eventually joins [[Kitty Pryde]]'s team of mutants in the pages of [[Ultimate Comics: X-Men]]. He elects to stay behind and defend a group of younger mutants in the Morlock tunnels while Kitty, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]], Jimmy Hudson, and Rogue decide to head to the Southwest to fight off the Sentinels.{{issue|date=February 2013}} He is later rescued wandering the streets of New York, having been severely tortured. The only clue to the fate of the children is a garbled phone call to Kitty by one of the children lamenting Johnny's disappearance.<ref>''Ultimate Comics X-Men'' #18 (Sept. 2013)</ref>

Johnny also makes an appearance in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game, in which he challenges Spider-Man to a series of races.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

[[Man-Beast]] negates the effects of the cosmic radiation for all of them except [[Brute (Reed Richards)|Reed Richards]] who succumbs to the effects a decade later.<ref>''Adam Warlock #6''</ref>  Johnny Storm's counterpart is revealed to have been killed by the cosmic radiation.{{issue|date=February 2013}}

===''What If?'' Vol. II #11===

In ''What If?'' vol. 2 #11 (March 1990), the origins of the Fantastic Four are retold, showing how the heroes lives would have changed if all four had gained the same powers as the individual members of the original Fantastic Four. In "Pyros", all have the power of the Human Torch; after the team sets fire to what they believe to be an uninhabited area in order to battle a monster, they inadvertently kill the daughter of a woman squatting one of those buildings; the guilt causes them to disband, after which Reed Richards returns to his research, Storm becomes a race car driver and Grimm adopts the Human Torch moniker and joins the Avengers. Susan Storm, who could never forgive herself for the child's death, took monastic vows and spent the rest of her life as a nun in penance. In "Team Elastics", all have the power of Mister Fantastic, but Grimm, Sue Storm and Reed Richards all believe their powers to be silly; which also causes Sue Storm to leave Reed. Reed Richards returns to his research, only using his powers to aid him in his work, such as handling dangerous chemicals at far range, and Sue marries Ben Grimm, where they live a quiet domestic life free of superpowers. Johnny is the only member to go public, where he becomes a performer called "Mr. Fabulous", using his powers to gain fame, fortune and women. In "Monstrous", all become monsters, and relocate to Monster Isle. In "The Phantoms", each gain one aspect of the invisibility power, with Johnny able to become intangible.  The story focuses on the four becoming a special secret unit of [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] which defends against an attack by, and ultimately captures and places in custody, Doom.<ref>''What If?'' vol. II #11/4</ref>
