'''Gwenpool''' ('''Gwendolyn "Gwen" Poole'''; [[colloquial]]: '''"GwenPool"''' or '''"Pink Slayer"''') is a [[fiction]]al [[Character (arts)|character]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. A girl from the [[Reality|real world]] transported to the [[Marvel Universe]], her physical design originated as an [[Composite character#Use in comics|amalgam]] of [[Gwen Stacy]] and [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson]] created by [[Chris Bachalo]] for a [[variant cover]] of ''Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars'' #2, which was one of twenty such variant covers published due to the popularity of [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]] from June [[2015 in comics|2015]].

Marvel initially produced two stories featuring Gwenpool as a character, created by [[Christopher Hastings]], [[Heather Antos]] and Jordan D. White: a backup story in the series ''[[Howard the Duck]]'',<ref>{{cite book |last1=DeFalco |first1=Tom |last2=Sanderson |first2=Peter |last3=Brevoort |first3=Tom |last4=Teitelbaum |first4=Michael |last5=Wallace |first5=Daniel |last6=Darling |first6=Andrew |last7=Forbeck |first7=Matt |last8=Cowsill |first8=Alan |last9=Bray |first9=Adam |title=The Marvel Encyclopedia |date=2019 |publisher=DK Publishing |isbn=978-1-4654-7890-0 |page=272}}</ref> and a [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot]] ''Gwenpool Holiday Special'', illustrated by [[Gurihiru]]. Following the publication of the one-shot, an ongoing series titled [[Unbelievable Gwenpool|''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'']] by the same creative team was announced, primarily illustrated by Gurihiru (with Irene Strychalski), which started in April [[2016 in comics|2016]] and concluded in April [[2018 in comics|2018]]. ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #0, collecting Poole's appearances from ''Howard the Duck'' and the first ''Gwenpool Holiday Special'', was later released, as well as the [[Limited series (comics)|limited series]] ''Gwenpool Strikes Back''.

==Publication history==
[[File:Gwen Stacy Deadpool Amalgam.jpeg|thumb|left|Gwenpool on the cover of ''Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars #2''|191px]]
In June 2015, following the popularity of [[Spider-Gwen]], all Marvel titles being published had alternate covers with [[Gwen Stacy]] reimagined as other characters, such as [[Doctor Strange]], [[Groot]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://marvel.com/news/comics/24438/gwen_takes_over |title=Gwen Takes Over &#124; News &#124; Marvel.com |access-date=4 July 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150416235453/http://marvel.com/news/comics/24438/gwen_takes_over |archive-date=16 April 2015 |url-status=bot: unknown }}</ref> One of those was [[Deadpool]], featured on  [[Chris Bachalo]]'s [[variant cover]] for ''Deadpool's Secret Secret Wars #2''.<ref>{{cite web|first=Rich|last=Johnston|url=http://www.bleedingcool.com/2015/08/21/and-finally-has-marvel-noticed-that-gwenpool-is-a-thing-now|title=And Finally… Has Marvel Noticed That Gwenpool Is A Thing Now?|publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]]|date=August 21, 2015}}</ref> After seeing how many fans were [[cosplaying]] as a character who was not even featured in any comic, Marvel editor Jordan White approached writer [[Christopher Hastings]] and editor Heather Antos with the task of creating a story around her. They would introduce the character with a three-issue backup story in the ongoing volume of ''[[Howard the Duck]]'' (November 2015–January 2016)<ref name=EW/><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/article/marvel-announces-gwenpool-one-shot-howard-the-duck-back-up-stories|title=Marvel Announces "''Gwenpool Holiday Special''," "''Howard the Duck''" Backup Stories|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=September 11, 2015}}</ref> and then a one-shot comic ''Gwenpool Special #1'' (December 2015). After a meeting with White and ''Howard the Duck'' editor Will Moss, Hastings came out with the idea of a character aware of the [[fourth wall]], "but it comes from this place of knowing she is in a comic book because she is from a world where the comic books actually exist", which would also initially lead to a cavalier attitude towards the world in which she inhabits "because she doesn’t believe there [are] any consequences to her actions", something Hastings summed as "she decides to [initially] use that [comic book] knowledge like she’s in ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' or something". A contrast would be that Gwenpool lacked any of the training or superpowers expected of Marvel characters.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://massappeal.com/marvel-gwenpool-2-christopher-hastings-interview/ |title=Writer Christopher Hastings Provides An Exclusive Look At Marvel's {{'}}''Gwenpool'' #2'|website=Mass Appeal|access-date=2017-05-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171019164858/https://massappeal.com/marvel-gwenpool-2-christopher-hastings-interview|archive-date=2017-10-19|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>[http://heroes.direct/interviews/christopher-hastings-interview/ Interview: Christopher Hastings on creating Gwenpool and writing ''Vote Loki'']</ref>

The ''Howard the Duck'' arc, from November 2015 to January 2016, was drawn by Brazilian artist [[Danilo Beyruth]], and the holiday special, published in December 2015, had art by Japanese duo [[Gurihiru]]. Once Marvel decided to make a Gwenpool ongoing series (named [[Unbelievable Gwenpool|''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'']]), starting in April 2016, Hastings asked for Gurihiru's return to the artwork team, with the title being edited by Antos.<ref name=EW>{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/12/21/marvel-announces-gwenpool|title=Marvel announces new Gwenpool series|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | date= December 22, 2015}}</ref> ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' solo series ended at issue #25.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cbr.com/marvel-cancels-generation-x-gwenpool-more/|title=Marvel Cancels Gwenpool, Generation X, Hawkeye and Potentially More|date=2017-12-19|work=[[Comic Book Resources|CBR]]|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}</ref> Gwenpool would then join the [[Fresh Start (comics)|Fresh Start]] incarnation of the [[West Coast Avengers]] in 2018. After that book ended, the character starred in the 2019 limited series ''Gwenpool Strikes Back'', written by Leah Williams and drawn by Spanish artist David Baldeón,<ref>{{cite news|url=https://bleedingcool.com/comics/gwenpool-strikes-back-in-new-mini-from-leah-williams-and-david-baldeon|title=Gwenpool Strikes Back in New Mini From Leah Williams and David Baldeon|publisher=[[Bleeding Cool]]|date=May 22, 2019|last=Terror|first=Jude|access-date=December 20, 2019}}</ref> and appeared in the 2020–21 promotional limited series ''MODOK: Head Games'' by [[M.O.D.O.K.

==Fictional character biography==
===Backstory===
Gwendolyn "Gwen" Poole arrived to the Marvel Universe from what she claims to be "[[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)#List of main alternate earths and universes|the real world]]".<ref>[[Christopher Hastings]] made the deliberate choice not to explain the mechanics of how Gwen Poole crossed into the Marvel Universe. In a farewell letter in [[Unbelievable Gwenpool|''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'']] #25, he stated it was the fans making content based around Gwenpool that elevated her from a simple idea for a variant cover, creating a collective force that pried open the walls of the [[Marvel Universe]] and shoved Gwen inside.</ref> In her home reality, Gwen had been a comics [[fan (person)|superfan]] as an [[escapism|escape]] from her life as an unemployed [[dropping out|high school dropout]]. Unwilling to be an "extra" in the Marvel world, she went to a tailor for superheroes and requested her own costume. The tailor (named Ronnie) complied, but misread Gwen's application form, and thought Gwen went by the alias of "Gwenpool", leading to a costume similar to [[Deadpool]]'s.<ref name="Howard the Duck Vol. 6 #1">[[Howard the Duck#Back to New York|''Howard the Duck'' vol. 6]] #1</ref> Upon gaining the ability to manipulate the borders of the [[fourth wall]] from an attempt to return her to reality, allowing her to travel in time, Gwen [[retcon]]s the Marvel Universe into believing her to be a [[Mutant (Marvel Comics)|mutant]] after being given the idea by [[Kamala Khan]], allowing her to enter the gates of [[Krakoa]].<ref name="Strikes Back 5">{{Cite book|title=Gwenpool Strikes Back ''#5''|publisher=Marvel|year=2019}}</ref>

===Solo series===
Gwenpool's first appearance as a character was in [[Howard the Duck#Back to New York|''Howard the Duck'' Vol 6 #1]] (later republished in ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' #0), when she was involved in stealing a humanity-destroying virus from [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and selling it to [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]] to get money easily, believing that the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] would simply deal with any consequences. When she revealed to [[Howard the Duck]] the item she had stolen from Hardy and to whom she had sold it, Howard scolded her and informed her that the Avengers were not available to save the Earth from the virus. Guilt stricken, she then set out with Howard to retrieve the virus from a Hydra base.<ref>[[Howard the Duck#Back to New York|''Howard the Duck'' Vol. 6]] #1–3. Marvel Comics.</ref>

In the 2015 ''Gwenpool Special'', Gwenpool is hired on her first mercenary job, to kill a villain. After completing her mission, Gwenpool attends a Christmas party hosted by [[She-Hulk]], where she's seen talking to [[Ms. Marvel (Kamala Khan)|Ms. Marvel]].<ref>''Gwenpool Special'' #1 (February 2015). Marvel Comics.</ref>

[[File:Gwenpool Unmasked.jpeg|thumb|right|Gwenpool unmasked|170px]]Following the events of ''Gwenpool Holiday Special'' #1, Gwenpool becomes a full-time mercenary.<ref>{{Cite book|title=[[Unbelievable Gwenpool|The Unbelievable Gwenpool]] ''#1''|publisher=Marvel|year=2016}}</ref> While trying to deposit the money she made killing Orto, Gwen stops a bank robbery by killing all of the robbers, except for the gang's hacker Cecil, whom she enlists as a reluctant sidekick. After a mission revolving around extraterrestrial arms dealers where she killed [[MODOK Superior]]'s best agent and took credit for his work, MODOK tracked Gwenpool down. He murdered Cecil in order to persuade her to become his henchman and an agent for his Mercenary Organization Dedicated Only to Killing. Gwenpool joins MODOK's elite squad, which also includes the alchemist Mega Tony, the magician Terrible Eye, and [[Batroc the Leaper]], who gives Gwen basic combat and firearms training.<ref name=":0">{{Cite book|title=The Unbelievable Gwenpool ''#2''|publisher=Marvel|year=2016}}</ref>

Gwenpool then arranged a meeting between herself and [[Doctor Strange]], in which she explained to him that she was from a reality where all Marvel characters are fictional characters in comic books. Doctor Strange agreed to transfer her history from Gwen's original world to create a fake background for her in the Marvel Universe, so that she could get her [[Social Security number]], [[driver's license]] and other essential documents. However, this allows MODOK Superior to discover Gwen's ordinary, powerless background, and he swears to destroy Gwen for lying to him and having no credentials to be a mercenary. Gwen and MODOK then engage in battle, and she defeats him with the hacking assistance of Cecil, who returns as a ghost.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Unbelievable Gwenpool ''#4''|publisher=Marvel|year=2016}}</ref>

Without MODOK, Gwen becomes the new leader of the MODOK organization, but learns she is wanted by the alien arms dealers, who are known as Teuthidans. Assisted by a rogue [[Doombot]] named Vincent Doonan and MODOK's other agents, Gwenpool's team defeats the Teuthidans, but destroys the MODOK base in the process. Without a base or funding, Batroc and the others decide to disband MODOK.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Unbelievable Gwenpool ''#10''|publisher=Marvel|year=2017}}</ref>

During the ''[[Civil War II]]'' storyline, Gwenpool appears in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] attempting to earn the bounty on an alien smuggler named Chammy, only to discover that [[Rocket Raccoon]] and [[Groot]] are also after him. The three end up fighting another alien named Reeve, who put the bounty on Chammy. After Reeve defeats them and escapes, Chammy tells Rocket, Groot and Gwen that Reeve is looking for a formula that could temporarily neutralize [[Carol Danvers|Captain Marvel]]'s powers, allowing him to kill her.  Gwen refuses to help at first, under the logic that Captain Marvel, being one of most important "characters" in the current "story", would not be killed off in "a comic about a talking tree and raccoon". However, after coincidentally running into [[Kitty Pryde]], Gwen falls under the mistaken impression that the comic she is currently in was being written by [[Brian Michael Bendis]], a "big-deal comic book writer" with a fixation on Pryde who would have the authority to kill Captain Marvel. Convinced that Captain Marvel’s life is actually in danger, Gwen accompanies Rocket & Groot to the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], where they and Chammy help defeat Reeve, and Gwen realizes that the real writer put Kitty Pryde on the street to trick her into helping.<ref>''Rocket Raccoon & Groot'' #8–10.

Marvel Comics.</ref>  [[Blade (comics)|Blade]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Unbelievable Gwenpool ''#11''|publisher=Marvel|year=2017}}</ref> [[Deadpool]],<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Unbelievable Gwenpool ''#12''|publisher=Marvel|year=2017}}</ref> and the duo of [[Ghost Rider (Robbie Reyes)|Ghost Rider]] and [[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|Kate Bishop]], Gwen meets her brother Teddy, who drags her back to her world (or a close facsimile).<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Unbelievable Gwenpool ''#16''|publisher=Marvel|year=2017}}</ref>

Here Gwen loses her memories of her time in the Marvel Universe and resumes an ordinary life, but she gradually becomes once again aware that she is in a comic book. Gwen then begins experimenting with the fourth wall again and learns to interact with the comic book medium by erasing the walls between panels and even climbing out of the panels, finding herself looking in on her life.

Watching the past from outside the borders, Gwen sees the "extra pages" of her ''Holiday Special'', in which when her brother Teddy was sucked into the Marvel Universe, he ended up working for Orto the snake swordsman. Upon seeing her kill Orto's henchmen, Teddy runs into versions of [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]], The Terrible Eye, and Vincent Doonan, who claim to be from a future where Gwen becomes a huge threat and destroys their lives. They offer him the chance to "return home" with his sister and fix things. Being concerned for Gwen's mental health, and having had a terrible time, he readily agrees. On finding this out Gwen, with her memory and costume restored, re-enters the borders, confronts Teddy for trying to undo the past and steal her dream of living in a comic, and shows him that their "parents" aren't real, and they never even left the comic.

Terrible Eye explains that their attempts to send the Pooles to their home dimension created a pocket dimension from their memories that was almost identical to their real one. The three realize that trapping Gwen was what led to her gaining her powers over reality in the first place. When Spider-Man narrates a flashback sequence of the future evil Gwen's misdeeds, the evil Gwen herself travels through the flashback's panels to follow him to the present.

Future Gwen battles Spider-Man, Terrible Eye, and Doonan, while each side tries to convince the present Gwen to join their cause. Future Gwen turns out to be weakened by Present Gwen’s doubt, but still effortlessly kills Doonan, Terrible Eye, and Spider-Man, horrifying Present Gwen, before explaining to her past self that she became a villain because she was tired of her good deeds being undone as the plot progressed, so she turned to committing evil that could always be undone on characters that “matter”, demonstrated when Spider-Man’s death is retconned a moment later because he’s too important in the story to be killed. However, Present Gwen is disgusted at the idea of hurting the characters she’s grown to love, and wipes her future self from existence. This comes at the cost of erasing all of the Evil Gwen stories and thus dramatically shortening Present Gwen’s lifespan.

Learning that the universe is attempting to make her into a joke villain, Gwen wants to make sure her evil self never comes to be. To catch the attention of the Avengers she visits Latveria in an attempt to face off with Doctor Doom, thinking him to still be evil, as she hasn't read ''[[Infamous Iron Man]]''. It is revealed that she and Cecil, now in his mystical monster body, share an apartment and since she has given up killing people is hacking to pay the bills. A short time later after rescuing Vincent Doonan from Paste Pot Pete and throwing him into the void between comic panels as a demonstration of her new superpower, Gwen asks Vincent where to find the real Doctor Doom so she can defeat him and prove herself to be a fameworthy hero. Vincent leads her to Doom, who explains he's reformed, but Gwen still attacks him, releasing an evil version of Doctor Doom from within him.

After a brief fight in which she realizes she can't kill the Doom doppelganger, the real Doom comes to her aid and destroys his evil past self. He and Gwen have a chat about why she wanted to kill him, which turns out to be because since destroying her evil destiny self, her comic pages are running out and she believes she is doomed to be cancelled. With only a few pages left, once Doom is gone, she wonders if she has to become a super villain.

In the final chapter of ''Unbelievable Gwenpool'', a Gwen from the future appears to her and explains that while her first comic series has ended, she's already in several other comics, toys, games, fan works, and so on. Even if her current book ends, she and her side characters will return in future stories. Meanwhile, in between these pages, Gwen enlists the help of Stephen Strange and her friends to restore Cecil to human form. She is given a watch that counts down the issue's remaining pages and she uses the rest, one page at a time, to see old friends, team up with new superheroes, rescue her brother from Hell, meet the Marvel Universe counterparts of her parents, and chase off M.O.D.O.K. one more time. Future Gwen then goes back to where the chapter started to talk to her past self, creating a loop.

===''West Coast Avengers'' Vol. 3===
After recently having been beaten up by a [[Human cloning|clone]] of [[Squirrel Girl]],<ref>''[[The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl#Graphic novels|The Unbeatable Squirrel Girl Beats Up the Marvel Universe]]'' Marvel Comics. (October 2016)</ref> and later attending the funeral of a separate [[Skrull]] duplicate of Squirrel Girl, Gwen visits Kate Bishop in Los Angeles, before being drafted to join the accidentally reformed [[West Coast Avengers]]. She instantly enters into conflict with one of the members, [[Quentin Quire]], but their clashes and shouting matches eventually evolve into passionate kisses. However, Gwen later informs the camera crew following the team that she started a relationship with Quentin partly because she felt a romantic plot would make her less of a supporting player and thus less likely to die, having also considered establishing a romantic relationship with [[Miss America (America Chavez)|America Chavez]].<ref>[[West Coast Avengers|''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 3]] #1–#5</ref> Along with the other Avengers, Gwen helps stop giant monsters created by the original M.O.D.O.K., adopts a baby land-shark she names [[Jeff (comics character)|Jeff]], and faces an alliance of villains headed by [[Madame Masque]].<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 3 #6–#10</ref> Later, during the [[War of the Realms]], Gwen and the West Coast Avengers assist [[Otto Octavius]] in protecting [[San Francisco]], and she uses her perspective as a Marvel Universe outsider and a fellow B-list hero to help him come to terms with his lack of a star role in the event.

Entering the Gutter, Gwen proceeds to rearrange the comic's pages and retcon MODOK's death to having been merely knocked out by an [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]]. Gwen helps MODOK discover his family's home from his memories, and MODOK grants Gwen his respect.<ref>''MODOK: Head Games'' #2–3 (January–February [[2021 in comics|2021]])</ref> Gwen is later seen wearing cosplay for a [[fan convention]],<ref>{{Cite web|last=Heinberg|first=Ganucheau|title=''Marvel's Voices: Pride'' (2021) #1|url=https://www.marvel.com/comics/issue/95052/marvels_voices_pride_2021_1|date=June 23, 2021|website=[[Marvel Entertainment]]|language=en|url-status=live}}</ref> and is also seen in [[Los Angeles]] celebrating the repeal of [[Outlawed (comics)#Plot|Kamala's Law]] with [[Robbie Reyes]] and the West Coast Avengers,<ref>[[Outlawed (comics)|''Champions'' Vol. 4 #9]] (September [[2021 in comics|2021]])</ref> and leaves a [[mug]] with her face on it to Kate as a parting gift.<ref>[[Hawkeye (Kate Bishop)|''Hawkeye: Kate Bishop'' #1]] (November [[2021 in comics|2021]])</ref>

An alternate universe's version of Gwen merges with a [[Symbiote (comics)|Venom Symbiote]] that has unique medium awareness and knowledge of the Marvel Multiverse,<ref>''[[Edge of Venomverse]]'' #2. Marvel Comics.</ref> but is killed and absorbed by the "Poisons" of ''Venomverse''.<ref>''[[Venomverse]]'' #4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

===''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe Again'' (2017)===
An alternate version of Gwen appears in the third issue of this miniseries. Gwen is hired by [[Moon Knight]] and [[Punisher (comics)|the Punisher]] to  find the location of definitely evil versions of [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]], [[Red Skull (comics)|the Red Skull]], [[Abomination (comics)|the Abomination]] and [[Doctor Doom]], who are controlling [[Deadpool]] to kill that Marvel Universe's heroes. As Gwen sends the photos, the Abomination proclaims "''I've got her''", leaving her fate unknown. Losing reception, Moon Knight remarks: "''Until we hear from her again, we should assume Gwenpool's '''DEAD'''''." In the same issue, it is revealed that the series takes place in a reality similar to that of ''Old Man Logan'', as Deadpool comes across the X-Men's Mansion after [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]] tricks [[Laura Kinney|Laura Kinney / Wolverine]] into slaughtering the X-Men. [[Old Man Logan]] realizes that this is what is happening over the course of the issue. Later, in the fourth issue, Gwenpool is revealed to be alive, asking [[Tinkerer|the Tinkerer]] to ask her "''a few '''quick questions'''''". Gwen proceeds to torture the Tinkerer, realizing that her "superhero pals" aren't answering any of her texts and calls and that the Tinkerer's masters have been using Deadpool to kill them. Gwenpool threatens the Tinkerer with more torture if he doesn't tell her how to break Deadpool's trance to stop him from killing everyone. Gwenpool then comes across Deadpool as he kills Nova, the last remaining superhero other than Gwenpool, and attempts to knock him out of his trance. Deadpool mocks Gwen as simply being a "'''''variant cover knockoff'''''" and  "'''''a Deadpool -- in pink!'''''". Gwenpool, suddenly impaled, uses her last moments to reverse Deadpool's trance, redirecting him towards the supervillains using the trigger phrases she learned from the Tinkerer. Gwenpool begs Deadpool "''don't let them get away with it''", as he proclaims: "''Bring on the Bad Guys''".<ref>''Deadpool Kills the Marvel Universe Again'' #3–4. Marvel Comics.</ref>

==Powers and abilities==
Gwenpool originally had no real superpowers, only vast knowledge of the [[Marvel Universe]] from comic books in her universe, such as every secret identity of both heroes and villains. She has used this information to take down [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]'s criminal empire<ref name="Howard the Duck Vol. 6 #1"/> and to stop [[Jane Foster (comics)|Thor]] from attacking her.<ref name=":0" /> She is able to exploit her fourth-wall knowledge to her advantage, understanding when comic-book tropes will allow her to avoid unpleasant or life-threatening consequences, such as falls that would realistically be lethal. She also seems to gain uncanny luck at dodging bullets and eluding enemies just by merit of being the hero of her story.

Gwenpool is trained in weapons and hand-to-hand combat by Batroc during ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' vol. 2. She continued to train after she left Batroc and with her skills much improved, she was able to take out a group of minions by herself while on the [[West Coast Avengers]] using acrobatics and her [[katana]]s.<ref>''West Coast Avengers'' vol. 3 #8. Marvel Comics.</ref>

Gwenpool is fully aware that she is in a comic,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marvel.com/characters/gwenpool/in-comics/profile|title=Gwenpool In Comics Profile {{!}} Marvel|website=Marvel.com|access-date=2018-08-11}}</ref> and can step out of and into comic panels, alter fictional characters, dump characters into the "gutter space" between panels, interact with word bubbles, and use her knowledge of the Marvel Universe to determine characters’ weaknesses. In ''West Coast Avengers'', Gwen notes she is not fully able to exploit the comics medium with her powers as she did in her own title, making her think it was part of a potential character [[Reboot (fiction)|reboot]], noting that her powers are specifically no longer working quite as well when other people are watching her.

In ''Gwenpool Strikes Back'' she learned she now has Evil Gwen's reality-manipulating powers to alter history by "recalling" flashback sequences, retroactively causing them to have happened. After Ms. Marvel, initially disbelieving of her reality being a comic, incorrectly theorises that Gwen is a reality-altering mutant whose abilities are based on other characters' disbelief that they live in a comic; while untrue, Gwen decides to temporarily retcon this theory as Marvel Universe reality, allowing her to live care-free in the mutant nation of [[Krakoa]] without her presence being questioned.

===Relationships===
'''Teddy Poole:''' Gwen's brother who was also brought to the Marvel universe. He is less prone to seeing the world as a comic book and has yet to show any of Gwen's powers, but seems immune to her ability to alter reality.

'''Cecil:''' An elite hacker who serves as Gwen's sidekick. He was briefly a ghost, but only to be brought back first as a giant monster and then himself by Gwen because she felt bad for getting him killed. He's an elite hacker and has a giant purple dog monster for a loyal pet. 

'''[[Batroc the Leaper]]:''' A semi-major supervillain and a mentor figure to Gwen. In contrast to his portrayals by other writers, ''The Unbelievable Gwenpool'' depicts him as with a more kind and helpful personality, at least to Gwen and her friends.

'''[[Doombot#Vincent Doonan|Vincent Doonan]]:''' A rogue Doombot who first hired Gwen when she defeated M.O.D.O.K.

'''Various Heroes and Villains:''' Gwen has made friends and enemies among various heroes and villains. They rarely believe Gwen when she tells them she is in a comic, and Ms. Marvel even suggested she might be a reality-altering mutant, ending in Gwen getting rewritten into that role. However Doctor Strange, Deadpool, Howard the Duck (himself from an alternate universe), Santa Claus, and potentially other fourth-wall breaking heroes have not only believed her but have been able to peer into her old life in "the real world" and even alter it. Doctor Strange gave Gwen an identity in the Marvel universe by taking it from hers.
