'''Spider-Man''' is a [[superhero]] character adapted by [[Insomniac Games]] originally for the 2018 video game ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Marvel's Spider-Man]]''. Based on the original character [[Spider-Man|of the same name]] created by [[Stan Lee]] and [[Steve Ditko]], the character was developed by Insomniac Games writers Jon Paquette, Benjamin Arfmann, and Kelsey Beachum, while he is voiced by [[Yuri Lowenthal]]. He has three signature suits: the Advanced Suit, the Velocity Suit designed by [[Adi Granov]], and the Resilient Suit designed by Gabriele Dell'Otto.

Insomniac's Spider-Man is depicted as a more mature and experienced version of the character, who has battled various [[List of Spider-Man enemies|supervillains]] in his eight-year career as the city's protector while still struggling to balance his superhero alter-ego with his life as Peter Parker.

The character was later established in [[Marvel Comics]] continuity as an [[Alternative versions of Spider-Man|alternate version of Spider-Man]] within the comics' [[Multiverse (Marvel Comics)|multiverse]] with a book adaption and spinoff comic book series. Insomniac's more mature take on the character was well received. Marketing and merchandising of the character mostly wearing the advanced suit was released before and after the original games' initial release.

The character's facial model was changed for ''[[Spider-Man: Miles Morales|Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales]]'' and ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)#Spider-Man Remastered|Marvel's Spider-Man Remastered]]'', to better match the facial capture of Yuri Lowenthal. This change has garnered mixed reactions.

Several characters from [[Marvel Comics]] were considered to have their own game developed by [[Insomniac Games]] but the team's final choice was to adapt [[Spider-Man]]. This was due to him and his true identity Peter Parker being more relatable to the staff than other Marvel characters such as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] and [[Iron Man]], a sentiment that Insomniac CEO [[Ted Price]] shared.<ref name="IGN">{{cite web |last=Barnett |first=Brian |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2018/09/10/how-insomniacs-spider-man-came-to-be-ign-unfiltered |title=How Insomniac's Spider-Man Came To Be |date=September 10, 2018 |website=[[IGN]] |access-date=January 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190117221649/https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/09/10/how-insomniacs-spider-man-came-to-be-ign-unfiltered |archive-date=January 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="web">{{cite web |last=Watts |first=Steve |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-how-insomniac-spun-its-web/1100-6464062/ |title=Marvel's Spider-Man: How Insomniac Spun Its Web |date=December 21, 2018 |website=[[GameSpot]] |access-date=January 17, 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190117225448/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-spider-man-how-insomniac-spun-its-web/1100-6464062/ |archive-date=January 17, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Spider-Man was the first licensed property by Insomniac in 22 years.<ref name="license">{{cite web |last=Mathew |first=Adam |url=https://www.redbull.com/au-en/insomniac-developer-interview-spider-man-ps4 |title=How deep is Insomniac's PS4 Spider-sensibility? |date=November 1, 2017 |publisher=[[Red Bull]] |access-date=January 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190116130437/https://www.redbull.com/au-en/insomniac-developer-interview-spider-man-ps4 |archive-date=January 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

Creative director Bryan Intihar collaborated with a team of writers under lead writer Jon Paquette to create an original take on a [[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]] that remained true to the original.<ref name="web"/> Paquette is cited to commonly subscribed to Spider-Man (''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' and ''[[Peter Parker: The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'') and also Thor [[American comic book|comic books]] at the "[[Boondocks|boonies]]" at a younger age before his time attending film school.<ref>{{cite web |title='Marvel's Spider-Man' is basically a playable superhero movie |url=https://ew.com/gaming/2018/08/02/marvels-spider-man-video-game-preview/ |website=EW.com |access-date=August 28, 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828024415/https://ew.com/gaming/2018/08/02/marvels-spider-man-video-game-preview/ |archive-date=August 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Alongside Paquette, the story was written by Ben Arfman and Kelsey Beachum.

One lesson the team took from the research was that whenever Spider-Man wins, Peter Parker loses, and vice versa. Intihar said that from conception, the game was designed to be as much Parker's story as Spider-Man's.<ref name="web"/> The team deliberately avoided retelling Spider-Man's origin, reasoning that everyone knows Spider-Man was bitten by a radioactive spider.<ref name="Changes"/>

[[Yuri Lowenthal]] provides the voice of Spider-Man / Peter Parker, but there was some initial reluctance to cast him as he had previously voiced a characteristically-different lead character in ''[[Sunset Overdrive]]'' and it was thought that he was not capable of providing a drastically different performance.<ref name="voice">{{cite web |last=Ruppert |first=Liana |url=https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/04/04/spider-man-ps4-peter-parker-yuri-lowenthal/ |title=Spider-Man PS4 Lead Voice Actor Almost Rejected by Insomniac |date=April 4, 2018 |website=comicbook.com |access-date=January 22, 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190122222500/https://comicbook.com/gaming/2018/04/04/spider-man-ps4-peter-parker-yuri-lowenthal/ |archive-date=January 22, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> Paquette trusted his acting ability however, and convinced the studio to cast him.<ref name="voice 2"/> Working with voice director Kris Zimmerman, Lowenthal tried to differentiate his voices for Parker in his civilian life where he is more gentle, and as Spider-Man, where he is more confident. As a result, he spent a large amount of time working on his performance to achieve a balance. Lowenthal worked with two stunt people throughout the game's development.<ref name="voice commentary">{{cite web |last=Salazar-Moreno |first=Quibian |url=https://www.gamecrate.com/interview-yuri-lowenthal-being-voice-spider-man-and-his-new-show-orbital-redux/20918 |title=Interview: Yuri Lowenthal On Being The Voice Of Spider-Man And His New Show, Orbital Redux |date=September 28, 2018 |publisher=[[Newegg]] |website=GameCrate.com |access-date=January 23, 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190123220350/https://www.gamecrate.com/interview-yuri-lowenthal-being-voice-spider-man-and-his-new-show-orbital-redux/20918 |archive-date=January 23, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref name="voice 2">{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/04/exclusive-interview-with-the-man-playing-spider-man.aspx|title=Exclusive Interview With The Man Playing Spider-Man|date=April 4, 2018|last=Vader|first=Leo|work=[[Game Informer]]|access-date=April 4, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180405043238/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/04/exclusive-interview-with-the-man-playing-spider-man.aspx|archive-date=April 5, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>

Insomniac wanted to modernize the design of Spider-Man's costume while paying homage to the original design by [[Steve Ditko]]. The new advanced costume design retains the traditional red-and-blue color scheme, a large white spider symbol stretching across the torso, gauntlet-like gloves, and sneaker-style design based on athletic wear instead of knee-high boots.<ref name="costume"/> Art director Jacinda Chew said the design goal was to create what a "23-year-old, would-be superhero" would wear in 2018 New York City. Chew compared the outfit to [[Compression garment|compression wear]], and said each color represented different materials. Blue is the most flexible, red is thicker for added protection from minor injury, and white offers the most protection, as it covers his chest, hands, and feet.<ref name="costume">{{cite web |last=Saveedra |first=John |title=Spider-Man PS4: New Spidey Costume Explained |url=https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/spider-man/276206/spider-man-ps4-new-spidey-costume-explained |date=September 11, 2018 |website=DenofGeek! |publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]] |access-date=January 16, 2019 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20190116114326/https://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/spider-man/276206/spider-man-ps4-new-spidey-costume-explained |archive-date=January 16, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Vader |first1=Leo |title=Designing The Look Of Spider-Man |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/20/designing-the-look-of-spider-man.aspx |magazine=Game Informer |access-date=August 28, 2019 |language=en |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190828041108/https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2018/04/20/designing-the-look-of-spider-man.aspx |archive-date=August 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>

===In-game face model replacement controversy===

[[Chris Stuckmann]] criticized the change as unnecessary, jarring and even detrimental to ''Miles Morales'' and the remaster.
